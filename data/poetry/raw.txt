spring the sweet spring is the year's pleasant king 
then blooms each thing then maids dance in a ring 
cold doth not sting the pretty birds do sing 
cuckoo jug-jug pu-we to-witta-woo 

the palm and may make country houses gay 
lambs frisk and play the shepherds pipe all day 
and we hear aye birds tune their merry lay 
cuckoo jug-jug pu-we to-witta-woo 

the fields breathe sweet the daisies kiss our feet 
young lovers meet old wives a-sunning sit 
in every street these tunes our ears do greet 
cuckoo jug-jug pu-we to-witta-woo 
spring the sweet spring 








phoebus arise 
and paint the sable skies
with azure white and red 
rouse memnon's mother from her tithon's bed
that she may thy career with roses spread 
the nightingales thy coming eachwhere sing 
make an eternal spring 
give life to this dark world which lieth dead 
spread forth thy golden hair
in larger locks than thou wast wont before 
and emperor-like decore
with diadem of pearl thy temples fair 
chase hence the ugly night
which serves but to make dear thy glorious light 

--this is that happy morn 
that day long wish d day
of all my life so dark 
 if cruel stars have not my ruin sworn
and fates not hope betray 
which purely white deserves
an everlasting diamond should it mark 
this is the morn should bring unto this grove
my love to hear and recompense my love 
fair king who all preserves 
but show thy blushing beams 
and thou two sweeter eyes
shalt see than those which by pen us' streams
did once thy heart surprize 
now flora deck thyself in fairest guise 
if that ye winds would hear
a voice surpassing far amphion's lyre 
your furious chiding stay 
let zephyr only breathe
and with her tresses play 
--the winds all silent are 
and phoebus in his chair
ensaffroning sea and air
makes vanish every star 
night like a drunkard reels
beyond the hills to shun his flaming wheels 
the fields with flowers are deck'd in every hue 
the clouds with orient gold spangle their blue 
here is the pleasant place--
and nothing wanting is save she alas 








when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of out-worn buried age 
when sometime lofty towers i see down-razed 
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage 

when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore 
and the firm soil win of the watery main 
increasing store with loss and loss with store 

when i have seen such interchange of state 
or state itself confounded to decay 
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
that time will come and take my love away 

--this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose 








since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea 
but sad mortality o'ersways their power 
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea 
whose action is no stronger than a flower 

o how shall summer's honey breath hold out 
against the wreckful siege of battering days 
when rocks impregnable are not so stout 
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays 

o fearful meditation where alack 
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid 
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back 
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid 

o none unless this miracle have might 
that in black ink my love may still shine bright 








come live with me and be my love 
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hills and valleys dale and field 
and all the craggy mountains yield 

there will we sit upon the rocks
and see the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers to whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals 

there will i make thee beds of roses
and a thousand fragrant posies 
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle 

a gown made of the finest wool 
which from our pretty lambs we pull 
fair-lined slippers for the cold 
with buckles of the purest gold 

a belt of straw and ivy-buds
with coral clasps and amber studs 
and if these pleasures may thee move 
come live with me and be my love 

thy silver dishes for thy meat
as precious as the gods do eat 
shall on an ivory table be
prepared each day for thee and me 

the shepherd swains shall dance and sing
for thy delight each may-morning 
if these delights thy mind may move 
then live with me and be my love 








crabbed age and youth
cannot live together 
youth is full of pleasance 
age is full of care 
youth like summer morn 
age like winter weather 
youth like summer brave 
age like winter bare 
youth is full of sport 
age's breath is short 
youth is nimble age is lame 
youth is hot and bold 
age is weak and cold 
youth is wild and age is tame --
age i do abhor thee 
youth i do adore thee 
o my love my love is young 
age i do defy thee--
o sweet shepherd hie thee 
for methinks thou stay'st too long 








under the greenwood tree
who loves to lie with me 
and tune his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat--
come hither come hither come hither 
here shall we see
no enemy
but winter and rough weather 

who doth ambition shun
and loves to live i' the sun 
seeking the food he eats
and pleased with what he gets--
come hither come hither come hither 
here shall he see
no enemy
but winter and rough weather 








it was a lover and his lass
with a hey and a ho and a hey-nonino 
that o'er the green cornfield did pass 
in the spring time the only pretty ring time 
when birds do sing hey ding a ding 
sweet lovers love the spring 
between the acres of the rye
these pretty country folks would lie 
this carol they began that hour 
how that life was but a flower 
and therefore take the present time
with a hey and a ho and a hey-nonino 
for love is crown d with the prime
in spring time the only pretty ring time 
when birds do sing hey ding a ding 
sweet lovers love the spring 








absence hear thou my protestation
against thy strength 
distance and length 
do what thou canst for alteration 
for hearts of truest mettle
absence doth join and time doth settle 

who loves a mistress of such quality 
he soon hath found
affection's ground
beyond time place and all mortality 
to hearts that cannot vary
absence is presence time doth tarry 

by absence this good means i gain 
that i can catch her 
where none can watch her 
in some close corner of my brain 
there i embrace and kiss her 
and so i both enjoy and miss her 








being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire 
i have no precious time at all to spend 
nor services to do till you require 

nor dare i chide the world-without-end hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you 
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu 

nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose 
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those --

so true a fool is love that in your will 
though you do any thing he thinks no ill 








how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year 
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen 
what old december's bareness everywhere 

and yet this time removed was summer's time 
the teeming autumn big with rich increase 
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease 

yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit 
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee 
and thou away the very birds are mute 

or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer 
that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near 








when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state 
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries 
and look upon myself and curse my fate 

wishing me like to one more rich in hope 
featured like him like him with friends possest 
desiring this man's art and that man's scope 
with what i most enjoy contented least 

yet in these thoughts my self almost despising 
haply i think on thee--and then my state 
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate 

for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings 








o never say that i was false of heart 
though absence seem'd my flame to qualify 
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie 

that is my home of love if i have ranged 
like him that travels i return again 
just to the time not with the time exchanged 
so that myself bring water for my stain 

never believe though in my nature reign'd
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood 
that it could so preposterously be stain'd
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good 

for nothing this wide universe i call 
save thou my rose in it thou art my all 








to me fair friend you never can be old 
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers' pride 

three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd 
in process of the seasons have i seen 
three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd 
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green 

ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand 
steal from his figure and no pace perceived 
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand 
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived 

for fear of which hear this thou age unbred --
ere you were born was beauty's summer dead 








diaphenia like the daffadowndilly 
white as the sun fair as the lily 
heigh ho how do i love thee 
i do love thee as my lambs
are belov d of their dams 
how blest were i if thou would'st prove me 

diaphenia like the spreading roses 
that in thy sweets all sweets encloses 
fair sweet how do i love thee 
i do love thee as each flower
loves the sun's life-giving power 
for dead thy breath to life might move me 

diaphenia like to all things bless d
when all thy praises are express d 
dear joy how do i love thee 
as the birds do love the spring 
or the bees their careful king 
then in requite sweet virgin love me 








like to the clear in highest sphere
where all imperial glory shines 
of selfsame colour is her hair
whether unfolded or in twines 
heigh ho fair rosaline 
her eyes are sapphires set in snow 
resembling heaven by every wink 
the gods do fear whenas they glow 
and i do tremble when i think
heigh ho would she were mine 

her cheeks are like the blushing cloud
that beautifies aurora's face 
or like the silver crimson shroud
that phoebus' smiling looks doth grace 
heigh ho fair rosaline 
her lips are like two budded roses
whom ranks of lilies neighbour nigh 
within which bounds she balm encloses
apt to entice a deity 
heigh ho would she were mine 

her neck like to a stately tower
where love himself imprison'd lies 
to watch for glances every hour
from her divine and sacred eyes 
heigh ho fair rosaline 
her paps are centres of delight 
her breasts are orbs of heavenly frame 
where nature moulds the dew of light
to feed perfection with the same 
heigh ho would she were mine 

with orient pearl with ruby red 
with marble white with sapphire blue 
her body every way is fed 
yet soft in touch and sweet in view 
heigh ho fair rosaline 
nature herself her shape admires 
the gods are wounded in her sight 
and love forsakes his heavenly fires
and at her eyes his brand doth light 
heigh ho would she were mine 

then muse not nymphs though i bemoan
the absence of fair rosaline 
since for a fair there's fairer none 
nor for her virtues so divine 
heigh ho fair rosaline 
heigh ho my heart would god that she were mine 








beauty sat bathing by a spring
where fairest shades did hide her 
the winds blew calm the birds did sing 
the cool streams ran beside her 

my wanton thoughts enticed mine eye
to see what was forbidden 
but better memory said fie 
so vain desire was chidden --
hey nonny nonny o 
hey nonny nonny 

into a slumber then i fell 
when fond imagination
seem d to see but could not tell
her feature or her fashion 
but ev'n as babes in dreams do smile 
and sometimes fall a-weeping 
so i awaked as wise this while
as when i fell a-sleeping --
hey nonny nonny o 
hey nonny nonny 








shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
thou art more lovely and more temperate 
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may 
and summer's lease hath all too short a date 

sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines 
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd 
and every fair from fair sometime declines 
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd 

but thy eternal summer shall not fade 
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest 
nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade 
when in eternal lines to time thou growest 

so long as men can breathe or eyes can see 
so long lives this and this gives life to thee 








when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights 
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights 

then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow 
i see their antique pen would have exprest
ev'n such a beauty as you master now 

so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring 
and for they look'd but with divining eyes 
they had not skill enough your worth to sing 

for we which now behold these present days 
have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 








on a day alack the day 
love whose month is ever may 
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air 
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen 'gan passage find 
that the lover sick to death 
wish'd himself the heaven's breath 
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow 
air would i might triumph so 
but alack my hand is sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn 
vow alack for youth unmeet 
youth so apt to pluck a sweet 
do not call it sin in me
that i am forsworn for thee 
thou for whom e'en jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were 
and deny himself for jove 
turning mortal for thy love 








forget not yet the tried intent
of such a truth as i have meant 
my great travail so gladly spent 
forget not yet 

forget not yet when first began
the weary life ye know since whan
the suit the service none tell can 
forget not yet 

forget not yet the great assays 
the cruel wrong the scornful ways 
the painful patience in delays 
forget not yet 

forget not o forget not this 
how long ago hath been and is
the mind that never meant amiss--
forget not yet 

forget not then thine own approved
the which so long hath thee so loved 
whose steadfast faith yet never moved--
forget not this 








o if thou knew'st how thou thyself does harm 
and dost prejudge thy bliss and spoil thy rest 
then thou would'st melt the ice out of thy breast
and thy relenting heart would kindly warm 

o if thy pride did not our joys controul 
what world of loving wonders should'st thou see 
for if i saw thee once transform'd in me 
then in thy bosom i would pour my soul 

then all my thoughts should in thy visage shine 
and if that aught mischanced thou should'st not moan
nor bear the burthen of thy griefs alone 
no i would have my share in what were thine 

and whilst we thus should make our sorrows one 
this happy harmony would make them none 








let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds 
or bends with the remover to remove --

o no it is an ever-fix d mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken 
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken 

love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come 
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks 
but bears it out ev'n to the edge of doom --

if this be error and upon me proved 
i never writ nor no man ever loved 








my true love hath my heart and i have his 
by just exchange one to the other given 
i hold his dear and mine he cannot miss 
there never was a better bargain driven 
my true love hath my heart and i have his 

his heart in me keeps him and me in one 
my heart in him his thoughts and senses guides 
he loves my heart for once it was his own 
i cherish his because in me it bides 
my true-love hath my heart and i have his 








were i as base as is the lowly plain 
and you my love as high as heaven above 
yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain
ascend to heaven in honour of my love 

were i as high as heaven above the plain 
and you my love as humble and as low
as are the deepest bottoms of the main 
whereso'er you were with you my love should go 

were you the earth dear love and i the skies 
my love should shine on you like to the sun 
and look upon you with ten thousand eyes
till heaven wax'd blind and till the world were done 

whereso'er i am below or else above you 
whereso'er you are my heart shall truly love you 








o mistress mine where are you roaming 
o stay and hear your true-love's coming
that can sing both high and low 
trip no further pretty sweeting 
journeys end in lovers' meeting--
every wise man's son doth know 

what is love 'tis not hereafter 
present mirth hath present laughter 
what's to come is still unsure 
in delay there lies no plenty --
then come kiss me sweet-and-twenty 
youth's a stuff will not endure 








when icicles hang by the wall
and dick the shepherd blows his nail 
and tom bears logs into the hall 
and milk comes frozen home in pail 
when blood is nipt and ways be foul 
then nightly sings the staring owl
tuwhoo 
tuwhit tuwhoo a merry note 
while greasy joan doth keel the pot 

when all around the wind doth blow 
and coughing drowns the parson's saw 
and birds sit brooding in the snow 
and marian's nose looks red and raw 
when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl--
then nightly sings the staring owl
tuwhoo 
tuwhit tuwhoo a merry note 
while greasy joan doth keel the pot 








that time of year thou may'st in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold 
bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang 

in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west 
which by and by black night doth take away 
death's second self that seals up all in rest 

in me thou seest the glowing of such fire 
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the deathbed whereon it must expire 
consumed with that which it was nourish'd by 

--this thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong 
to love that well which thou must leave ere long 








when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past 
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought 
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste

then can i drown an eye unused to flow 
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night 
and weep afresh love's long-since-cancell'd woe 
and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight 

then can i grieve at grievances foregone 
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of fore-bemoan d moan 
which i new pay as if not paid before 

--but if the while i think on thee dear friend 
all losses are restored and sorrows end 








like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end 
each changing place with that which goes before 
in sequent toil all forwards do contend 

nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd 
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight 
and time that gave doth now his gift confound 

time doth transfix the flourish set on youth 
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow 
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth 
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow 

and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand 








farewell thou art too dear for my possessing 
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate 
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing 
my bonds in thee are all determinate 

for how do i hold thee but by thy granting 
and for that riches where is my deserving 
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting 
and so my patent back again is swerving 

thyself thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing 
or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking 
so thy great gift upon misprision growing 
comes home again on better judgement making 

thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter 
in sleep a king but waking no such matter 








they that have power to hurt and will do none 
that do not do the thing they most do show 
who moving others are themselves as stone 
unmov d cold and to temptation slow --

they rightly do inherit heaven's graces 
and husband nature's riches from expense 
they are the lords and owners of their faces 
others but stewards of their excellence 

the summer's flower is to the summer sweet 
though to itself it only live and die 
but if that flower with base infection meet 
the basest weed outbraves his dignity 

for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds 
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 








and wilt thou leave me thus 
say nay say nay for shame 
to save thee from the blame
of all my grief and grame 
and wilt thou leave me thus 
say nay say nay 

and wilt thou leave me thus 
that hath loved thee so long
in wealth and woe among 
and is thy heart so strong
as for to leave me thus 
say nay say nay 

and wilt thou leave me thus 
that hath given thee my heart
never for to depart
neither for pain nor smart 
and wilt thou leave me thus 
say nay say nay 

and wilt thou leave me thus 
and have no more pity
of him that loveth thee 
alas thy cruelty 
and wilt thou leave me thus 
say nay say nay 








as it fell upon a day
in the merry month of may 
sitting in a pleasant shade
which a grove of myrtles made 
beasts did leap and birds did sing 
trees did grow and plants did spring 
every thing did banish moan
save the nightingale alone 
she poor bird as all forlorn 
lean'd her breast against a thorn 
and there sung the dolefullest ditty 
that to hear it was great pity 
fie fie fie now would she cry 
tereu tereu by and by 
that to hear her so complain
scarce i could from tears refrain 
for her griefs so lively shown
made me think upon mine own 
--ah thought i thou mourn'st in vain 
none takes pity on thy pain 
senseless trees they cannot hear thee 
ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee 
king pandion he is dead 
all thy friends are lapp'd in lead 
all thy fellow birds do sing
careless of thy sorrowing 
even so poor bird like thee 
none alive will pity me 








care-charmer sleep son of the sable night 
brother to death in silent darkness born 
relieve my anguish and restore the light 
with dark forgetting of my care return 

and let the day be time enough to mourn
the shipwreck of my ill adventured youth 
let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn 
without the torment of the night's untruth 

cease dreams the images of day-desires 
to model forth the passions of the morrow 
never let rising sun approve you liars
to add more grief to aggravate my sorrow 

still let me sleep embracing clouds in vain 
and never wake to feel the day's disdain 








take o take those lips away
that so sweetly were forsworn 
and those eyes the break of day 
lights that do mislead the morn 
but my kisses bring again 
bring again--
seals of love but seal'd in vain 
seal'd in vain 








since there's no help come let us kiss and part --
nay i have done you get no more of me 
and i am glad yea glad with all my heart 
that thus so cleanly i myself can free 

shake hands for ever cancel all our vows 
and when we meet at any time again 
be it not seen in either of our brows
that we one jot of former love retain 

now at the last gasp of love's latest breath 
when his pulse failing passion speechless lies 
when faith is kneeling by his bed of death 
and innocence is closing up his eyes 

--now if thou wouldst when all have given him over 
from death to life thou might'st him yet recover 








my lute be as thou wert when thou did'st grow
with thy green mother in some shady grove 
when immelodious winds but made thee move 
and birds their ramage did on thee bestow 

since that dear voice which did thy sounds approve 
which wont in such harmonious strains to flow 
is reft from earth to tune those spheres above 
what art thou but a harbinger of woe 

thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more 
but orphan's wailings to the fainting ear 
each stroke a sigh each sound draws forth a tear 
for which be silent as in woods before 

or if that any hand to touch thee deign 
like widow'd turtle still her loss complain 








o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight 
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright 

if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote 
what means the world to say it is not so 
if it be not then love doth well denote 
love's eye is not so true as all men's no 

how can it o how can love's eye be true 
that is so vex'd with watching and with tears 
no marvel then though i mistake my view 
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears 

o cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind 
lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find 








while that the sun with his beams hot
scorch d the fruits in vale and mountain 
philon the shepherd late forgot 
sitting beside a crystal fountain 
in shadow of a green oak tree
upon his pipe this song play'd he 
adieu love adieu love untrue love 
untrue love untrue love adieu love 
your mind is light soon lost for new love 

so long as i was in your sight
i was your heart your soul and treasure 
and evermore you sobb'd and sigh'd
burning in flames beyond all measure 
--three days endured your love to me 
and it was lost in other three 
adieu love adieu love untrue love 
untrue love untrue love adieu love 
your mind is light soon lost for new love 

another shepherd you did see
to whom your heart was soon enchain d 
full soon your love was leapt from me 
full soon my place he had obtain d 
soon came a third your love to win 
and we were out and he was in 
adieu love adieu love untrue love 
untrue love untrue love adieu love 
your mind is light soon lost for new love 

sure you have made me passing glad
that you your mind so soon remov d 
before that i the leisure had
to choose you for my best belov d 
for all your love was past and done
two days before it was begun --
adieu love adieu love untrue love 
untrue love untrue love adieu love 
your mind is light soon lost for new love 








if women could be fair and yet not fond 
or that their love were firm not fickle still 
i would not marvel that they make men bond
by service long to purchase their good will 
but when i see how frail those creatures are 
i muse that men forget themselves so far 

to mark the choice they make and how they change 
how oft from phoebus they do flee to pan 
unsettled still like haggards wild they range 
these gentle birds that fly from man to man 
who would not scorn and shake them from the fist 
and let them fly fair fools which way they list 

yet for disport we fawn and flatter both 
to pass the time when nothing else can please 
and train them to our lure with subtle oath 
till weary of their wiles ourselves we ease 
and then we say when we their fancy try 
to play with fools o what a fool was i 








blow blow thou winter wind 
thou art not so unkind
as man's ingratitude 
thy tooth is not so keen 
because thou art not seen 
although thy breath be rude 
heigh ho sing heigh ho unto the green holly 
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly 
then heigh ho the holly 
this life is most jolly 

freeze freeze thou bitter sky 
that dost not bite so nigh
as benefits forgot 
though thou the waters warp 
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remember'd not 
heigh ho sing heigh ho unto the green holly 
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly 
then heigh ho the holly 
this life is most jolly 








my thoughts hold mortal strife 
i do detest my life 
and with lamenting cries
peace to my soul to bring
oft call that prince which here doth monarchise 
--but he grim grinning king 
who caitiffs scorns and doth the blest surprise 
late having deck'd with beauty's rose his tomb 
disdains to crop a weed and will not come 








come away come away death 
and in sad cypres let me be laid 
fly away fly away breath 
i am slain by a fair cruel maid 
my shroud of white stuck all with yew 
o prepare it 
my part of death no one so true
did share it 

not a flower not a flower sweet 
on my black coffin let there be strown 
not a friend not a friend greet
my poor corpse where my bones shall thrown 
a thousand thousand sighs to save 
lay me o where
sad true lover never find my grave 
to weep there 








fear no more the heat o' the sun 
nor the furious winter's rages 
thou thy worldly task hast done 
home art gone and ta'en thy wages 
golden lads and girls all must 
as chimney-sweepers come to dust 

fear no more the frown o' the great 
thou art past the tyrant's stroke 
care no more to clothe and eat 
to thee the reed is as the oak 
the sceptre learning physic must
all follow this and come to dust 

fear no more the lightning flash
nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone 
fear not slander censure rash 
thou hast finish'd joy and moan 
all lovers young all lovers must
consign to thee and come to dust 








full fathom five thy father lies 
of his bones are coral made 
those are pearls that were his eyes 
nothing of him that doth fade 
but doth suffer a sea-change
into something rich and strange 
sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell 
hark now i hear them --
ding dong bell 








call for the robin-redbreast and the wren 
since o'er shady groves they hover
and with leaves and flowers do cover
the friendless bodies of unburied men 
call unto his funeral dole
the ant the field-mouse and the mole
to rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm
and when gay tombs are robb'd sustain no harm 
but keep the wolf far thence that's foe to men 
for with his nails he'll dig them up again 








if thou survive my well-contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover 
and shalt by fortune once more re-survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceas d lover 

compare them with the bettering of the time 
and though they be outstripp'd by every pen 
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men 

o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought--
 had my friend's muse grown with this growing age 
a dearer birth than this his love had brought 
to march in ranks of better equipage 

but since he died and poets better prove 
theirs for their style i'll read his for his love 








no longer mourn for me when i am dead
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell 

nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so 
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe 

o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse 
but let your love even with my life decay 

lest the wise world should look into your moan 
and mock you with me after i am gone 








tell me where is fancy bred 
or in the heart or in the head 
how begot how nourish d 
reply reply 
it is engender'd in the eyes 
with gazing fed and fancy dies
in the cradle where it lies 
let us all ring fancy's knell 
i'll begin it --ding dong bell 
--ding dong bell 








cupid and my campaspe play'd
at cards for kisses cupid paid 
he stakes his quiver bow and arrows 
his mother's doves and team of sparrows 
loses them too then down he throws
the coral of his lip the rose
growing on's cheek but none knows how 
with these the crystal of his brow 
and then the dimple on his chin 
all these did my campaspe win 
at last he set her both his eyes--
she won and cupid blind did rise 
o love has she done this to thee 
what shall alas become of me 








pack clouds away and welcome day 
with night we banish sorrow 
sweet air blow soft mount larks aloft
to give my love good-morrow 
wings from the wind to please her mind 
notes from the lark i'll borrow 
bird prune thy wing nightingale sing 
to give my love good-morrow 
to give my love good-morrow
notes from them both i'll borrow 

wake from thy nest robin-redbreast 
sing birds in every furrow 
and from each hill let music shrill
give my fair love good-morrow 
blackbird and thrush in every bush 
stare linnet and cock-sparrow 
you pretty elves amongst yourselves
sing my fair love good-morrow 
to give my love good-morrow
sing birds in every furrow 








calm was the day and through the trembling air
sweet-breathing zephyrus did softly play--
a gentle spirit that lightly did delay
hot titan's beams which then did glister fair 
when i whom sullen care 
through discontent of my long fruitless stay
in princes' court and expectation vain
of idle hopes which still do fly away
like empty shadows did afflict my brain 
walk'd forth to ease my pain
along the shore of silver-streaming thames 
whose rutty bank the which his river hems 
was painted all with variable flowers 
and all the meads adorn'd with dainty gems
fit to deck maidens' bowers 
and crown their paramours
against the bridal day which is not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

there in a meadow by the river's side 
a flock of nymphs i chanc d to espy 
all lovely daughters of the flood thereby 
with goodly greenish locks all loose untied
as each had been a bride 
and each one had a little wicker basket
made of fine twigs entrail d curiously 
in which they gather'd flowers to fill their flasket 
and with fine fingers cropt full feateously
the tender stalks on high 
of every sort which in that meadow grew
they gather'd some the violet pallid blue 
the little daisy that at evening closes 
the virgin lily and the primrose true 
with store of vermeil roses 
to deck their bridegrooms' posies
against the bridal day which was not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

with that i saw two swans of goodly hue
come softly swimming down along the lee 
two fairer birds i yet did never see 
the snow which doth the top of pindus strow 
did never whiter show 
nor jove himself when he a swan would be
for love of leda whiter did appear 
yet leda was they say as white as he 
yet not so white as these nor nothing near 
so purely white they were 
that even the gentle stream the which them bare 
seem'd foul to them and bade his billows spare
to wet their silken feathers lest they might
soil their fair plumes with water not so fair 
and mar their beauties bright
that shone as heaven's light
against their bridal day which was not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

eftsoons the nymphs which now had flowers their fill 
ran all in haste to see that silver brood
as they came floating on the crystal flood 
whom when they saw they stood amaz d still
their wondering eyes to fill 
them seem'd they never saw a sight so fair
of fowls so lovely that they sure did deem
them heavenly born or to be that same pair
which through the sky draw venus' silver team 
for sure they did not seem
to be begot of any earthly seed 
but rather angels or of angels' breed 
yet were they bred of summer's heat they say 
in sweetest season when each flower and weed
the earth did fresh array 
so fresh they seem'd as day 
even as their bridal day which was not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

then forth they all out of their baskets drew
great store of flowers the honour of the field 
that to the sense did fragrant odours yield 
all which upon those goodly birds they threw
and all the waves did strew 
that like old peneus' waters they did seem
when down along by pleasant tempe's shore
scatter'd with flowers through thessaly they stream 
that they appear through lilies' plenteous store 
like a bride's chamber-floor 
two of those nymphs meanwhile two garlands bound
of freshest flowers which in that mead they found 
the which presenting all in trim array 
their snowy foreheads therewithal they crown'd
whilst one did sing this lay
prepar'd against that day 
against their bridal day which was not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

 ye gentle birds the world's fair ornament 
and heaven's glory whom this happy hour
doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower 
joy may you have and gentle hearts content
of your loves complement 
and let fair venus that is queen of love 
with her heart-quelling son upon you smile 
whose smile they say hath virtue to remove
all love's dislike and friendship's faulty guile
for ever to assoil 
let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord 
and bless d plenty wait upon your board 
and let your bed with pleasures chaste abound 
that fruitful issue may to you afford
which may your foes confound 
and make your joys redound
upon your bridal day which is not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

so ended she and all the rest around
to her redoubled that her undersong 
which said their bridal day should not be long 
and gentle echo from the neighbour ground
their accents did resound 
so forth those joyous birds did pass along
adown the lee that to them murmur'd low 
as he would speak but that he lack'd a tongue 
yet did by signs his glad affection show 
making his stream run slow 
and all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
'gan flock about these twain that did excel
the rest so far as cynthia doth shend
the lesser stars so they enrang d well 
did on those two attend 
and their best service lend
against their wedding day which was not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

at length they all to merry london came 
to merry london my most kindly nurse 
that to me gave this life's first native source 
though from another place i take my name 
an house of ancient fame 
there when they came whereas those bricky towers
the which on thames' broad ag d back do ride 
where now the studious lawyers have their bowers 
there whilome wont the templar-knights to bide 
till they decay'd through pride 
next whereunto there stands a stately place 
where oft i gain d gifts and goodly grace
of that great lord which therein wont to dwell 
whose want too well now feels my friendless case 
but ah here fits not well
old woes but joys to tell
against the bridal day which is not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer 
great england's glory and the world's wide wonder 
whose dreadful name late thro' all spain did thunder 
and hercules' two pillars standing near
did make to quake and fear 
fair branch of honour flower of chivalry 
that fillest england with thy triumphs' fame
joy have thou of thy noble victory 
and endless happiness of thine own name
that promiseth the same 
that through thy prowess and victorious arms 
thy country may be freed from foreign harms 
and great eliza's glorious name may ring
through all the world fill'd with thy wide alarms
which some brave muse may sing
to ages following 
upon the bridal day which is not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 

from those high towers this noble lord iss ing 
like radiant hesper when his golden hair
in th' ocean billows he hath bath d fair 
descended to the river's open viewing
with a great train ensuing 
above the rest were goodly to be seen
two gentle knights of lovely face and feature 
beseeming well the bower of any queen 
with gifts of wit and ornaments of nature 
fit for so goodly stature 
that like the twins of jove they seem'd in sight
which deck the baldric of the heavens bright 
they two forth pacing to the river's side 
received those two fair brides their love's delight 
which at th' appointed tide 
each one did make his bride
against their bridal day which is not long 
sweet thames run softly till i end my song 








art thou poor yet hast thou golden slumbers 
o sweet content 
art thou rich yet is thy mind perplex d 
o punishment 
dost thou laugh to see how fools are vex d
to add to golden numbers golden numbers 
o sweet content o sweet o sweet content 
work apace apace apace apace 
honest labour bears a lovely face 
then hey nonny nonny hey nonny nonny 

canst drink the waters of the crisp d spring 
o sweet content 
swimm'st thou in wealth yet sink'st in thine own tears 
o punishment 
then he that patiently want's burden bears 
no burden bears but is a king a king 
o sweet content o sweet o sweet content 
work apace apace apace apace 
honest labour bears a lovely face 
then hey nonny nonny hey nonny nonny 








this life which seems so fair 
is like a bubble blown up in the air
by sporting children's breath 
who chase it everywhere
and strive who can most motion it bequeath 
and though it sometimes seem of its own might
like to an eye of gold to be fix'd there 
and firm to hover in that empty height 
that only is because it is so light 
--but in that pomp it doth not long appear 
for when 'tis most admir d in a thought 
because it erst was nought it turns to nought 








poor soul the centre of my sinful earth 
fool'd by those rebel powers that thee array 
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth 
painting thy outward walls so costly gay 

why so large cost having so short a lease 
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend 
shall worms inheritors of this excess 
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end 

then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss 
and let that pine to aggravate thy store 
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross 
within be fed without be rich no more --

so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men 
and death once dead there's no more dying then 








the world's a bubble and the life of man
less than a span 
in his conception wretched from the womb
so to the tomb 
curst from his cradle and brought up to years
with cares and fears 
who then to frail mortality shall trust 
but limns on water or but writes in dust 

yet whilst with sorrow here we live opprest 
what life is best 
courts are but only superficial schools
to dandle fools 
the rural parts are turn'd into a den
of savage men 
and where's a city from foul vice so free 
but may be term'd the worst of all the three 

domestic cares afflict the husband's bed 
or pains his head 
those that live single take it for a curse 
or do things worse 
some would have children those that have them moan
or wish them gone 
what is it then to have or have no wife 
but single thraldom or a double strife 

our own affections still at home to please
is a disease 
to cross the seas to any foreign soil 
peril and toil 
wars with their noise affright us when they cease 
we are worse in peace --
what then remains but that we still should cry
for being born or being born to die








of this fair volume which we world do name
if we the sheets and leaves could turn with care 
of him who it corrects and did it frame 
we clear might read the art and wisdom rare 

find out his power which wildest powers doth tame 
his providence extending everywhere 
his justice which proud rebels doth not spare 
in every page no period of the same 

but silly we like foolish children rest
well pleased with colour'd vellum leaves of gold 
fair dangling ribbands leaving what is best 
on the great writer's sense ne'er taking hold 

or if by chance we stay our minds on aught 
it is some picture on the margin wrought 








doth then the world go thus doth all thus move 
is this the justice which on earth we find 
is this that firm decree which all doth bind 
are these your influences powers above 

those souls which vice's moody mists most blind 
blind fortune blindly most their friend doth prove 
and they who thee poor idle virtue love 
ply like a feather toss'd by storm and wind 

ah if a providence doth sway this all 
why should best minds groan under most distress 
or why should pride humility make thrall 
and injuries the innocent oppress 

heavens hinder stop this fate or grant a time
when good may have as well as bad their prime 








tired with all these for restful death i cry--
as to behold desert a beggar born 
and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity 
and purest faith unhappily forsworn 

and gilded honour shamefully misplaced 
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted 
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced 
and strength by limping sway disabl d

and art made tongue-tied by authority 
and folly doctor-like controlling skill 
and simple truth miscall'd simplicity 
and captive good attending captain ill --

--tired with all these from these would i be gone 
save that to die i leave my love alone 








the last and greatest herald of heaven's king
girt with rough skins hies to the deserts wild 
among that savage brood the woods forth bring 
which he more harmless found than man and mild 

his food was locusts and what there doth spring
with honey that from virgin hives distill'd 
parch'd body hollow eyes some uncouth thing
made him appear long since from earth exiled 

there burst he forth all ye whose hopes rely
on god with me amidst these deserts mourn 
repent repent and from old errors turn 
--who listen'd to his voice obey'd his cry 

only the echoes which he made relent 
rung from their flinty caves repent repent 












this division embracing the latter eighty years of the seventeenth
century contains the close of our early poetical style and the
commencement of the modern in dryden we see the first master of the
new in milton whose genius dominates here as shakespeare's in the
former book --the crown and consummation of the early period their
splendid odes are far in advance of any prior attempts spenser's
excepted they exhibit the wider and grander range which years and
experience and the struggles of the time conferred on poetry poetry now
gave expression to political feeling to religious thought to a high
philosophic statesmanship in writers such as marvell herbert and
wotton whilst in marvell and milton again we find the first noble
attempts at pure description of nature destined in our own ages to be
continued and equalled meanwhile the poetry of simple passion although
before often deformed by verbal fancies and conceits of thought 
and afterward by levity and an artificial tone --produced in herrick and
waller some charming pieces of more finished art than the elizabethan 
until in the courtly compliments of sedley it seems to exhaust itself 
and lie almost dormant for the hundred years between the days of wither
and suckling and the days of burns and cowper --that the change from our
early style to the modern brought with it at first a loss of nature and
simplicity is undeniable yet the far bolder and wider scope which
poetry took between and and the successful efforts then made
to gain greater clearness in expression in their results have been no
slight compensation 







this is the month and this the happy morn
wherein the son of heaven's eternal king
of wedded maid and virgin mother born 
our great redemption from above did bring 
for so the holy sages once did sing
that he our deadly forfeit should release 
and with his father work us a perpetual peace 

that glorious form that light unsufferable 
and that far-beaming blaze of majesty
wherewith he wont at heaven's high council-table
to sit the midst of trinal unity 
he laid aside and here with us to be 
forsook the courts of everlasting day 
and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay 

say heavenly muse shall not thy sacred vein
afford a present to the infant god 
hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain
to welcome him to this his new abode 
now while the heaven by the sun's team untrod 
hath took no print of the approaching light 
and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright 

see how from far upon the eastern road 
the star-led wizards haste with odours sweet 
o run prevent them with thy humble ode
and lay it lowly at his blessed feet 
have thou the honour first thy lord to greet 
and join thy voice unto the angel quire
from out his secret altar touch'd with hallow'd fire 



it was the winter wild
while the heaven-born child
all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies
nature in awe to him
had doff'd her gaudy trim 
with her great master so to sympathise 
it was no season then for her
to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour 

only with speeches fair
she woos the gentle air
to hide her guilty front with innocent snow 
and on her naked shame 
pollute with sinful blame 
the saintly veil of maiden white to throw 
confounded that her maker's eyes
should look so near upon her foul deformities 

but he her fears to cease 
sent down the meek-eyed peace 
she crown'd with olive green came softly sliding
down through the turning sphere
his ready harbinger 
with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing 
and waving wide her myrtle wand 
she strikes a universal peace through sea and land 

no war or battle's sound
was heard the world around 
the idle spear and shield were high up hung 
the hook d chariot stood
unstain'd with hostile blood 
the trumpet spake not to the arm d throng 
and kings sat still with awful eye 
as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by 

but peaceful was the night
wherin the prince of light
his reign of peace upon the earth began 
the winds with wonder whist 
smoothly the waters kist
whispering new joys to the mild oce n--
who now hath quite forgot to rave 
while birds of calm sit brooding on the charm d wave 

the stars with deep amaze
stand fix'd in steadfast gaze 
bending one way their precious influence 
and will not take their flight
for all the morning light 
or lucifer that often warn'd them thence 
but in their glimmering orbs did glow 
until their lord himself bespake and bid them go 

and though the shady gloom
had given day her room 
the sun himself withheld his wonted speed 
and hid his head for shame 
as his inferior flame
the new-enlightn'd world no more should need 
he saw a greater sun appear
then his bright throne or burning axletree could bear 

the shepherds on the lawn
or ere the point of dawn
sate simply chatting in a rustic row 
full little thought they then
that the mighty pan
was kindly come to live with them below 
perhaps their loves or else their sheep
was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep 

when such music sweet
their hearts and ears did greet
as never was by mortal finger strook--
divinely-warbled voice
answering the string d noise 
as all their souls in blissful rapture took 
the air such pleasure loth to lose 
with thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close 

nature that heard such sound
beneath the hollow round
of cynthia's seat the airy region thrilling 
now was almost won
to think her part was done 
and that her reign had here its last fulfilling 
she knew such harmony alone
could hold all heaven and earth in happier union 

at last surrounds their sight
a globe of circular light
that with long beams the shamefaced night array'd 
the helm d cherubim
and sworded seraphim 
are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd 
harping in loud and solemn quire
with unexpressive notes to heaven's new-born heir 

such music as 'tis said 
before was never made
but when of old the sons of morning sung 
while the creator great
his constellations set
and the well-balanced world on hinges hung 
and cast the dark foundations deep 
and bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep 

ring out ye crystal spheres 
once bless our human ears 
if ye have power to touch our senses so 
and let your silver chime
move in melodious time 
and let the bass of heaven's deep organ blow 
and with your ninefold harmony
make up full concert to the angelic symphony 

for if such holy song
enwrap our fancy long 
time will run back and fetch the age of gold 
and speckled vanity
will sicken soon and die 
and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould 
and hell itself will pass away 
and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day 

yea truth and justice then
will down return to men 
orb'd in a rainbow and like glories wearing 
mercy will sit between
throned in celestial sheen 
with radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering 
and heaven as at some festival 
will open wide the gates of her high palace hall 

but wisest fate says no 
this must not yet be so 
the babe yet lies in smiling infancy
that on the bitter cross
must redeem our loss 
so both himself and us to glorify 
yet first to those ychain'd in sleep
the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep 

with such a horrid clang
as on mount sinai rang
while the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake 
the aged earth agast
with terrour of that blast
shall from the surface to the centre shake 
when at the worlds last sessi n 
the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne 

and then at last our bliss
full and perfect is 
but now begins for from this happy day
the old dragon under ground
in straiter limits bound 
not half so far casts his usurp d sway 
and wroth to see his kingdom fail 
swinges the scaly horrour of his folded tail 

the oracles are dumb 
no voice or hideous hum
runs through the arch d roof in words deceiving 
apollo from his shrine
can no more divine 
with hollow shriek the steep of delphos leaving 
no nightly trance or breath d spell
inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell 

the lonely mountains o'er
and the resounding shore
a voice of weeping heard and loud lament 
from haunted spring and dale
edged with poplar pale
the parting genius is with sighing sent 
with flower-inwoven tresses torn
the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn 

in consecrated earth
and on the holy hearth 
the lars and lemur s moan with midnight plaint 
in urns and altars round
a drear and dying sound
affrights the flamens at their service quaint 
and the chill marble seems to sweat 
while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat 

peor and baalim
forsake their temples dim 
with that twice-batter'd god of palestine
and moon d ashtaroth
heaven's queen and mother both 
now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine 
the lybic hammon shrinks his horn 
in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thammuz mourn 

and sullen moloch fled 
hath left in shadows dread
his burning idol all of blackest hue 
in vain with cymbals' ring
they call the grisly king 
in dismal dance about the furnace blue 
the brutish gods of nile as fast
isis and orus and the dog anubis haste 

nor is osiris seen
in memphian grove or green 
trampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud 
nor can he be at rest
within his sacred chest 
naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud 
in vain with timbrell'd anthems dark
the sable stol d sorcerers bear his worshipt ark 

he feels from juda's land
the dreaded infant's hand 
the rays of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn 
nor all the gods beside
longer dare abide 
nor typhon huge ending in snaky twine 
our babe to shew his godhead true 
can in his swaddling bands control the damn d crew 

so when the sun in bed
curtain'd with cloudy red
pillows his chin upon an orient wave 
the flocking shadows pale
troop to the infernal jail 
each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave 
and the yellow-skirted fays
fly after the night-steeds leaving their moon-loved maze 

but see the virgin blest
hath laid her babe to rest 
time is our tedious song should here have ending 
heavens youngest-teem d star 
hath fixed her polish'd car 
her sleeping lord with hand-maid lamp attending 
and all about the courtly stable
bright-harness'd angels sit in order serviceable 










from harmony from heavenly harmony
this universal frame began 
when nature underneath a heap
of jarring atoms lay
and could not heave her head 
the tuneful voice was heard from high
arise ye more than dead 
then cold and hot and moist and dry
in order to their stations leap 
and music's power obey 
from harmony from heavenly harmony
this universal frame began 
from harmony to harmony
through all the compass of the notes it ran 
the diapason closing full in man 

what passion cannot music raise and quell 
when jubal struck the chorded shell
his listening brethren stood around 
and wondering on their faces fell
to worship that celestial sound 
less than a god they thought there could not dwell
within the hollow of that shell 
that spoke so sweetly and so well 
what passion cannot music raise and quell 

the trumpet's loud clangor
excites us to arms 
with shrill notes of anger 
and mortal alarms 
the double double double beat
of the thundering drum
cries hark the foes come 
charge charge 'tis too late to retreat 

the soft complaining flute
in dying notes discovers
the woes of hopeless lovers 
whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling lute 

sharp violins proclaim
their jealous pangs and desperation 
fury frantic indignation 
depth of pains and height of passion
for the fair disdainful dame 

but oh what art can teach 
what human voice can reach
the sacred organ's praise 
notes inspiring holy love 
notes that wing their heavenly ways
to mend the choirs above 
orpheus could lead the savage race 
and trees uprooted left their place
sequacious of the lyre 
but bright cecilia raised the wonder higher 
when to her organ vocal breath was given
an angel heard and straight appear'd--
mistaking earth for heaven 

 grand chorus 

as from the power of sacred lays
the spheres began to move 
and sung the great creator's praise
to all the blest above 
so when the last and dreadful hour
this crumbling pageant shall devour 
the trumpet shall be heard on high 
the dead shall live the living die 
and music shall untune the sky 








avenge o lord thy slaughter'd saints whose bones
lie scatter'd on the alpine mountains cold 
even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
when all our fathers worshipt stocks and stones 

forget not in thy book record their groans
who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold
slain by the bloody piemontese that roll'd
mother with infant down the rocks their moans

the vales redoubled to the hills and they
to heaven their martyr'd blood and ashes sow
o'er all the italian field where still doth sway
the triple tyrant that from these may grow
a hundred-fold who having learnt thy way 
early may fly the babylonian woe 








the forward youth that would appear 
must now forsake his muses dear 
nor in the shadows sing
his numbers languishing 

'tis time to leave the books in dust 
and oil the unused armour's rust 
removing from the wall
the corslet of the hall 

so restless cromwell could not cease
in the inglorious arts of peace 
but through adventurous war
urg d his active star 

and like the three-fork'd lightning first
breaking the clouds where it was nurst 
did thorough his own side
his fiery way divide 

for 'tis all one to courage high
the emulous or enemy 
and with such to enclose
is more than to oppose 

then burning through the air he went
and palaces and temples rent 
and caesar's head at last
did through his laurels blast 

'tis madness to resist or blame
the face of angry heaven's flame 
and if we would speak true 
much to the man is due

who from his private gardens where
he lived reserv d and austere
 as if he his highest plot
to plant the bergamot 

could by industrious valour climb
to ruin the great work of time 
and cast the kingdoms old
into another mould 

though justice against fate complain 
and plead the ancient rights in vain--
but those do hold or break
as men are strong or weak 

nature that hateth emptiness 
allows of penetration less 
and therefore must make room
where greater spirits come 

what field of all the civil war
where his were not the deepest scar 
and hampton shows what part
he had of wiser art 

where twining subtle fears with hope 
he wove a net of such a scope
that charles himself might chase
to carisbrook's narrow case 

that thence the royal actor borne
the tragic scaffold might adorn 
while round the arm d bands
did clap their bloody hands 

he nothing common did or mean
upon that memorable scene 
but with his keener eye
the axe's edge did try 

nor call'd the gods with vulgar spite 
to vindicate his helpless right 
but bow'd his comely head
down as upon a bed 

--this was that memorable hour
which first assured the forc d power 
so when they did design
the capitol's first line 

a bleeding head where they begun 
did fright the architects to run 
and yet in that the state
foresaw its happy fate 

and now the irish are ashamed
to see themselves in one year tamed 
so much one man can do
that does both act and know 

they can affirm his praises best 
and have though overcome confest
how good he is how just
and fit for highest trust 

nor yet grown stiffer with command 
but still in the republic's hand--
how fit he is to sway
that can so well obey 

he to the commons' feet presents
a kingdom for his first year's rents 
and what he may forbears
his fame to make it theirs 

and has his sword and spoils ungirt
to lay them at the public's skirt 
so when the falcon high
falls heavy from the sky 

she having kill'd no more doth search
but on the next green bough to perch 
where when he first does lure 
the falconer has her sure 

--what may not then our isle presume
while victory his crest does plume 
what may not others fear
if thus he crowns each year 

as caesar he ere long to gaul 
to italy an hannibal 
and to all states not free
shall climacteric be 

the pict no shelter now shall find
within his parti-colour'd mind 
but from this valour sad
shrink underneath the plaid--

happy if in the tufted brake
the english hunter him mistake 
nor lay his hounds in near
the caledonian deer 

but thou the war's and fortune's son 
march indefatigably on 
and for the last effect
still keep the sword erect 

besides the force it has to fright
the spirits of the shady night 
the same arts that did gain
a power must it maintain 








 elegy on a friend drowned in the irish channel 

yet once more o ye laurels and once more
ye myrtles brown with ivy never sere 
i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude 
and with forced fingers rude
shatter your leaves before the mellowing year 
bitter constraint and sad occasion dear
compels me to disturb your season due 
for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime 
young lycidas and hath not left his peer 
who would not sing for lycidas he knew
himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme 
he must not float upon his watery bier
unwept and welter to the parching wind 
without the meed of some melodious tear 

begin then sisters of the sacred well
that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring 
begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string 
hence with denial vain and coy excuse 
so may some gentle muse
with lucky words favour my destined urn 
and as he passes turn
and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud 

for we were nursed upon the self-same hill 
fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill 
together both ere the high lawns appear'd
under the opening eye-lids of the morn 
we drove a-field and both together heard
what time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn 
battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night 
oft till the star that rose at evening bright
toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel 
meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute 
temper'd to the oaten flute 
rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel
from the glad sound would not be absent long 
and old damoetas loved to hear our song 

but o the heavy change now thou art gone 
now thou art gone and never must return 
thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves 
with wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown 
and all their echoes mourn 
the willows and the hazel copses green
shall now no more be seen
fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays --
as killing as the canker to the rose 
or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze 
or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear 
when first the white-thorn blows 
such lycidas thy loss to shepherds' ear 

where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep
closed o'er the head of your loved lycidas 
for neither were ye playing on the steep
where your old bards the famous druids lie 
nor on the shaggy top of mona high 
nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream 
ay me i fondly dream--
had ye been there--for what could that have done 
what could the muse herself that orpheus bore 
the muse herself for her enchanting son 
whom universal nature did lament 
when by the rout that made the hideous roar
his gory visage down the stream was sent 
down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore 

alas what boots it with incessant care
to tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade
and strictly meditate the thankless muse 
were it not better done as others use 
to sport with amaryllis in the shade 
or with the tangles of neaera's hair 
fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
 that last infirmity of noble mind 
to scorn delights and live laborious days 
but the fair guerdon when we hope to find 
and think to burst out into sudden blaze 
comes the blind fury with the abhorr d shears
and slits the thin-spun life but not the praise 
phoebus replied and touch'd my trembling ears 
 fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil 
nor in the glistering foil
set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies 
but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
and perfect witness of all-judging jove 
as he pronounces lastly on each deed 
of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed 

o fountain arethuse and thou honour'd flood
smooth-sliding mincius crown'd with vocal reeds 
that strain i heard was of a higher mood 
but now my oat proceeds 
and listens to the herald of the sea
that came in neptune's plea 
he ask'd the waves and ask'd the felon winds 
what hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain 
and question'd every gust of rugged wings
that blows from off each beak d promontory 
they knew not of his story 
and sage hippotad s their answer brings 
that not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd 
the air was calm and on the level brine
sleek panop with all her sisters play'd 
it was that fatal and perfidious bark
built in the eclipse and rigg'd with curses dark 
that sunk so low that sacred head of thine 

next camus reverend sire went footing slow 
his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge
inwrought with figures dim and on the edge
like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe 
 ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge 
last came and last did go
the pilot of the galilean lake 
two massy keys he bore of metals twain
 the golden opes the iron shuts amain 
he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake 
 how well could i have spared for thee young swain 
enow of such as for their bellies' sake
creep and intrude and climb into the fold 
of other care they little reckoning make
than how to scramble at the shearers' feast 
and shove away the worthy bidden guest 
blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold
a sheep-hook or have learn'd aught else the least
that to the faithful herdman's art belongs 
what recks it them what need they they are sped 
and when they list their lean and flashy songs
grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw 
the hungry sheep look up and are not fed 
but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw
rot inwardly and foul contagion spread 
besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
daily devours apace and nothing said 
--but that two-handed engine at the door
stands ready to smite once and smite no more 

return alph us the dread voice is past
that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse 
and call the vales and bid them hither cast
their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues 
ye valleys low where the mild whispers use
of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks
on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks 
throw hither all your quaint enamell'd eyes
that on the green turf suck the honey'd showers
and purple all the ground with vernal flowers 
bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies 
the tufted crow-toe and pale jessamine 
the white pink and the pansy freak'd with jet 
the glowing violet 
the musk-rose and the well-attired woodbine 
with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head 
and every flower that sad embroidery wears 
bid amaranthus all his beauty shed 
and daffodillies fill their cups with tears
to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies 
for so to interpose a little ease 
let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise 
ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
wash far away --where'er thy bones are hurl'd 
whether beyond the stormy hebrides
where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
visitest the bottom of the monstrous world 
or whether thou to our moist vows denied 
sleep'st by the fable of bellerus old 
where the great vision of the guarded mount
looks toward namancos and bayona's hold 
--look homeward angel now and melt with ruth 
--and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth 

weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more 
for lycidas your sorrow is not dead 
sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 
so sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed 
and yet anon repairs his drooping head
and tricks his beams and with new-spangled ore
flames in the forehead of the morning sky 
so lycidas sunk low but mounted high
through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves 
where other groves and other streams along 
with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves 
and hears the unexpressive nuptial song
in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love 
there entertain him all the saints above
in solemn troops and sweet societies 
that sing and singing in their glory move 
and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes 
now lycidas the shepherds weep no more 
henceforth thou art the genius of the shore 
in thy large recompense and shalt be good
to all that wander in that perilous flood 

thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills 
while the still morn went out with sandals gray 
he touch'd the tender stops of various quills 
with eager thought warbling his doric lay 
and now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills 
and now was dropt into the western bay 
at last he rose and twitch'd his mantle blue 
to-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new 








mortality behold and fear
what a change of flesh is here 
think how many royal bones
sleep within these heaps of stones 
here they lie had realms and lands 
who now want strength to stir their hands 
where from their pulpits seal'd with dust
they preach in greatness is no trust 
here's an acre sown indeed
with the richest royallest seed
that the earth did e'er suck in
since the first man died for sin 
here the bones of birth have cried
 though gods they were as men they died 
here are sands ignoble things 
dropt from the ruin'd sides of kings
here's a world of pomp and state
buried in dust once dead by fate 








victorious men of earth no more
proclaim how wide your empires are 
though you bind-in every shore
and your triumphs reach as far
as night and day 
yet you proud monarchs must obey
and mingle with forgotten ashes when
death calls ye to the crowd of common men 

devouring famine plague and war 
each able to undo mankind 
death's servile emissaries are 
nor to these alone confined 
he hath at will
more quaint and subtle ways to kill 
a smile or kiss as he will use the art 
shall have the cunning skill to break a heart 








the glories of our blood and state
are shadows not substantial things 
there is no armour against fate 
death lays his icy hand on kings 
sceptre and crown
must tumble down 
and in the dust be equal made
with the poor crooked scythe and spade 

some men with swords may reap the field 
and plant fresh laurels where they kill 
but their strong nerves at last must yield 
they tame but one another still 
early or late
they stoop to fate 
and must give up their murmuring breath
when they pale captives creep to death 

the garlands wither on your brow 
then boast no more your mighty deeds 
upon death's purple altar now
see where the victor-victim bleeds 
your heads must come
to the cold tomb 
only the actions of the just
smell sweet and blossom in their dust 








captain or colonel or knight in arms 
whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize 
if deed of honour did thee ever please 
guard them and him within protect from harms 

he can requite thee for he knows the charms
that call fame on such gentle acts as these 
and he can spread thy name o'er lands and seas 
whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms 

lift not thy spear against the muses' bower 
the great emathian conqueror bid spare
the house of pindarus when temple and tower
went to the ground and the repeated air
of sad electra's poet had the power
to save the athenian walls from ruin bare 








when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days in this dark world and wide 
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless though my soul more bent

to serve therewith my maker and present
my true account lest he returning chide --
doth god exact day-labour light denied 
i fondly ask --but patience to prevent

that murmur soon replies god doth not need
either man's work or his own gifts who best
bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state

is kingly thousands at his bidding speed
and post o'er land and ocean without rest --
they also serve who only stand and wait 








how happy is he born and taught
that serveth not another's will 
whose armour is his honest thought
and simple truth his utmost skill 

whose passions not his masters are 
whose soul is still prepared for death 
not tied unto the world by care
of public fame or private breath 

who envies none that chance doth raise
or vice who never understood
how deepest wounds are given by praise 
nor rules of state but rules of good 

who hath his life from rumours freed 
whose conscience is his strong retreat 
whose state can neither flatterers feed 
nor ruin make accusers great 

who god doth late and early pray
more of his grace than gifts to lend 
and entertains the harmless day
with a well-chosen book or friend 

--this man is freed from servile bands
of hope to rise or fear to fall 
lord of himself though not of lands 
and having nothing yet hath all 








it is not growing like a tree
in bulk doth make man better be 
or standing long an oak three hundred year 
to fall a log at last dry bald and sere 
a lily of a day
is fairer far in may 
although it fall and die that night--
it was the plant and flower of light 
in small proportions we just beauties see 
and in short measures life may perfect be 








when god at first made man 
having a glass of blessings standing by 
let us said he pour on him all we can 
let the world's riches which dispers d lie 
contract into a span 

so strength first made a way 
then beauty flow'd then wisdom honour pleasure 
when almost all was out god made a stay 
perceiving that alone of all his treasure 
rest in the bottom lay 

for if i should said he 
bestow this jewel also on my creature 
he would adore my gifts instead of me 
and rest in nature not the god of nature 
so both should losers be 

yet let him keep the rest 
but keep them with repining restlessness 
let him be rich and weary that at least 
if goodness lead him not yet weariness
may toss him to my breast 








happy those early days when i
shined in my angel-infancy 
before i understood this place
appointed for my second race 
or taught my soul to fancy aught
but a white celestial thought 
when yet i had not walk'd above
a mile or two from my first love 

and looking back at that short space
could see a glimpse of his bright face 
when on some gilded cloud or flower
my gazing soul would dwell an hour 
and in those weaker glories spy
some shadows of eternity 
before i taught my tongue to wound
my conscience with a sinful sound 
or had the black art to dispense
a several sin to every sense 
but felt through all this fleshly dress
bright shoots of everlastingness 

o how i long to travel back 
and tread again that ancient track 
that i might once more reach that plain 
where first i left my glorious train 
from whence th' enlighten'd spirit sees
that shady city of palm trees 
but ah my soul with too much stay
is drunk and staggers in the way --
some men a forward motion love 
but i by backward steps would move 
and when this dust falls to the urn 
in that state i came return 








lawrence of virtuous father virtuous son 
now that the fields are dank and ways are mire 
where shall we sometimes meet and by the fire
help waste a sullen day what may be won

from the hard season gaining time will run
on smoother till favonius re-inspire
the frozen earth and cloth in fresh attire
the lily and rose that neither sow'd nor spun 

what neat repast shall feast us light and choice 
of attic taste with wine whence we may rise
to hear the lute well touch'd or artful voice

warble immortal notes and tuscan air 
he who of those delights can judge and spare
to interpose them oft is not unwise 








cyriack whose grandsire on the royal bench
of british themis with no mean applause
pronounced and in his volumes taught our laws 
which others at their bar so often wrench 

to-day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench
in mirth that after no repenting draws 
let euclid rest and archimedes pause 
and what the swede intends and what the french 

to measure life learn thou betimes and know
toward solid good what leads the nearest way 
for other things mild heaven a time ordains 

and disapproves that care though wise in show 
that with superfluous burden loads the day 
and when god sends a cheerful hour refrains 








queen and huntress chaste and fair 
now the sun is laid to sleep 
seated in thy silver chair
state in wonted manner keep 
hesperus entreats thy light 
goddess excellently bright 

earth let not thy envious shade
dare itself to interpose 
cynthia's shining orb was made
heaven to clear when day did close 
bless us then with wish d sight 
goddess excellently bright 

lay thy bow of pearl apart
and thy crystal-shining quiver 
give unto the flying hart
space to breathe how short soever 
thou that mak'st a day of night 
goddess excellently bright 








whoe'er she be 
that not impossible she
that shall command my heart and me 

where'er she lie 
lock'd up from mortal eye
in shady leaves of destiny 

till that ripe birth
of studied fate stand forth 
and teach her fair steps to our earth 

till that divine
idea take a shrine
of crystal flesh through which to shine 

--meet you her my wishes 
bespeak her to my blisses 
and be ye call'd my absent kisses 

i wish her beauty 
that owes not all its duty
to gaudy tire or glist'ring shoe-tie 

something more than
taffata or tissue can 
or rampant feather or rich fan 

a face that's best
by its own beauty drest 
and can alone command the rest 

a face made up
out of no other shop
than what nature's white hand sets ope 

sydneian showers
of sweet discourse whose powers
can crown old winter's head with flowers 

whate'er delight
can make day's forehead bright
or give down to the wings of night 

soft silken hours 
open suns shady bowers 
'bove all nothing within that lowers 

days that need borrow
no part of their good morrow
from a fore-spent night of sorrow 

days that in spite
of darkness by the light
of a clear mind are day all night 

life that dares send
a challenge to his end 
and when it comes say welcome friend 

i wish her store
of worth may leave her poor
of wishes and i wish--no more 

--now if time knows
that her whose radiant brows
weave them a garland of my vows 

her that dares be
what these lines wish to see 
i seek no further it is she 

'tis she and here
lo i unclothe and clear
my wishes' cloudy character 

such worth as this is
shall fix my flying wishes 
and determine them to kisses 

let her full glory 
my fancies fly before ye 
be ye my fictions --but her story 








over the mountains
and over the waves 
under the fountains
and under the graves 
under floods that are deepest 
which neptune obey 
over rocks that are steepest
love will find out the way 

when there is no place
for the glow-worm to lie 
when there is no space
for receipt of a fly 
when the midge dares not venture
lest herself fast she lay 
if love come he will enter
and will find out his way 

you may esteem him
a child for his might 
or you may deem him
a coward from his flight 
but if she whom love doth honour
be conceal'd from the day 
set a thousand guards upon her 
love will find out the way 

some think to lose him
by having him confined 
and some do suppose him 
poor thing to be blind 
but if ne'er so close ye wall him 
do the best that you may 
blind love if so ye call him 
will find out his way 

you may train the eagle
to stoop to your fist 
or you may inveigle
the phoenix of the east 
the lioness ye may move her
to give o'er her prey 
but you'll ne'er stop a lover 
he will find out his way 








ah chloris could i now but sit
as unconcern'd as when
your infant beauty could beget
no happiness or pain 
when i the dawn used to admire 
and praised the coming day 
i little thought the rising fire
would take my rest away 

your charms in harmless childhood lay
like metals in a mine 
age from no face takes more away
than youth conceal'd in thine 
but as your charms insensibly
to their perfection prest 
so love as unperceived did fly 
and center'd in my breast 

my passion with your beauty grew 
while cupid at my heart
still as his mother favour'd you 
threw a new flaming dart 
each gloried in their wanton part 
to make a lover he
employ'd the utmost of his art--
to make a beauty she 








gather ye rose-buds while ye may 
old time is still a-flying 
and this same flower that smiles to-day 
to-morrow will be dying 

the glorious lamp of heaven the sun 
the higher he's a-getting
the sooner will his race be run 
and nearer he's to setting 

that age is best which is the first 
when youth and blood are warmer 
but being spent the worse and worst
times still succeed the former 

then be not coy but use your time 
and while ye may go marry 
for having lost but once your prime 
you may for ever tarry 








tell me not sweet i am unkind
that from the nunnery
of thy chaste breast and quiet mind 
to war and arms i fly 

true a new mistress now i chase 
the first foe in the field 
and with a stronger faith embrace
a sword a horse a shield 

yet this inconstancy is such
as you too shalt adore 
i could not love thee dear so much 
loved i not honour more 








you meaner beauties of the night 
which poorly satisfy our eyes
more by your number than your light 
you common people of the skies 
what are you when the moon shall rise 

ye violets that first appear 
by your pure purple mantles known
like the proud virgins of the year
as if the spring were all your own --
what are you when the rose is blown 

you curious chanters of the wood
that warble forth dame nature's lays 
thinking your passions understood
by your weak accents what's your praise
when philomel her voice doth raise 

so when my mistress shall be seen
in sweetness of her looks and mind 
by virtue first then choice a queen 
tell me if she were not design'd
th' eclipse and glory of her kind 








daughter to that good earl once president
of england's council and her treasury 
who lived in both unstain'd with gold or fee 
and left them both more in himself content 

till the sad breaking of that parliament
broke him as that dishonest victory
at chaeronia fatal to liberty 
kill'd with report that old man eloquent --

though later born than to have known the days
wherein your father flourish'd yet by you 
madam methinks i see him living yet 

so well your words his noble virtues praise 
that all both judge you to relate them true 
and to possess them honour'd margaret 








it is not beauty i demand 
a crystal brow the moon's despair 
nor the snow's daughter a white hand 
nor mermaid's yellow pride of hair 

tell me not of your starry eyes 
your lips that seem on roses fed 
your breasts where cupid tumbling lies 
nor sleeps for kissing of his bed --

a bloomy pair of vermeil cheeks
like hebe's in her ruddiest hours 
a breath that softer music speaks
than summer winds a-wooing flowers 

these are but gauds nay what are lips 
coral beneath the ocean-stream 
whose brink when your adventurer slips
full oft he perisheth on them 

and what are cheeks but ensigns oft
that wave hot youth to fields of blood 
did helen's breast though ne'er so soft 
do greece or ilium any good 

eyes can with baleful ardour burn 
poison can breathe that erst perfumed 
there's many a white hand holds an urn
with lovers hearts to dust consumed 

for crystal brows there's nought within 
they are but empty cells for pride 
he who the syren's hair would win
is mostly strangled in the tide 

give me instead of beauty's bust 
a tender heart a loyal mind
which with temptation i would trust 
yet never link'd with error find --

one in whose gentle bosom i
could pour my secret heart of woes 
like the care-burthen'd honey-fly
that hides his murmurs in the rose --

my earthly comforter whose love
so indefeasible might be
that when my spirit wonn'd above 
hers could not stay for sympathy 








he that loves a rosy cheek
or a coral lip admires 
or from star-like eyes doth seek
fuel to maintain his fires 
as old time makes these decay 
so his flames must waste away 

but a smooth and steadfast mind 
gentle thoughts and calm desires 
hearts with equal love combined 
kindle never-dying fires --
where these are not i despise
lovely cheeks or lips or eyes 








sweet be not proud of those two eyes
which starlike sparkle in their skies 
nor be you proud that you can see
all hearts your captives yours yet free 
be you not proud of that rich hair
which wantons with the lovesick air 
whenas that ruby which you wear 
sunk from the tip of your soft ear 
will last to be a precious stone 
when all your world of beauty's gone 








go lovely rose 
tell her that wastes her time and me 
that now she knows 
when i resemble her to thee 
how sweet and fair she seems to be 

tell her that's young 
and shuns to have her graces spied 
that hadst thou sprung
in deserts where no men abide 
thou must have uncommended died 

small is the worth
of beauty from the light retired 
bid her come forth 
suffer herself to be desired 
and not blush so to be admired 

then die that she
the common fate of all things rare
may read in thee 
how small a part of time they share
that are so wondrous sweet and fair 








drink to me only with thine eyes 
and i will pledge with mine 
or leave a kiss but in the cup
and i'll not look for wine 
the thirst that from the soul doth rise
doth ask a drink divine 
but might i of jove's nectar sup 
i would not change for thine 

i sent thee late a rosy wreath 
not so much honouring thee
as giving it a hope that there
it could not wither'd be 
but thou thereon didst only breathe
and sent'st it back to me 
since when it grows and smells i swear 
not of itself but thee 








there is a garden in her face
where roses and white lilies blow 
a heavenly paradise is that place 
wherein all pleasant fruits do grow 
there cherries grow that none may buy 
till cherry-ripe themselves do cry 

those cherries fairly do enclose
of orient pearl a double row 
which when her lovely laughter shows 
they look like rose-buds fill'd with snow 
yet them no peer nor prince can buy
till cherry-ripe themselves do cry 

her eyes like angels watch them still 
her brows like bended bows do stand 
threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill
all that approach with eye or hand
these sacred cherries to come nigh 
--till cherry-ripe themselves do cry 










a sweet disorder in the dress
kindles in clothes a wantonness --
a lawn about the shoulders thrown
into a fine distracti n --
an erring lace which here and there
enthrals the crimson stomacher --
a cuff neglectful and thereby
ribbands to flow confusedly --
a winning wave deserving note 
in the tempestuous petticoat --
a careless shoe-string in whose tie
i see a wild civility --
do more bewitch me than when art
is too precise in every part 








whenas in silks my julia goes
then then methinks how sweetly flows
that liquefaction of her clothes 

next when i cast mine eyes and see
that brave vibration each way free 
o how that glittering taketh me 








my love in her attire doth shew her wit 
it doth so well become her 
for every season she hath dressings fit 
for winter spring and summer 
no beauty she doth miss
when all her robes are on
but beauty's self she is
when all her robes are gone 








that which her slender waist confined
shall now my joyful temples bind 
no monarch but would give his crown
his arms might do what this has done 

it was my heaven's extremest sphere 
the pale which held that lovely deer 
my joy my grief my hope my love
did all within this circle move 

a narrow compass and yet there
dwelt all that's good and all that's fair 
give me but what this ribband bound 
take all the rest the sun goes round 








bid me to live and i will live
thy protestant to be 
or bid me love and i will give
a loving heart to thee 

a heart as soft a heart as kind 
a heart as sound and free
as in the whole world thou canst find 
that heart i'll give to thee 

bid that heart stay and it will stay 
to honour thy decree 
or bid it languish quite away 
and 't shall do so for thee 

bid me to weep and i will weep 
while i have eyes to see 
and having none yet i will keep
a heart to weep for thee 

bid me despair and i'll despair 
under that cypress tree 
or bid me die and i will dare
e'en death to die for thee 

thou art my life my love my heart 
the very eyes of me 
and hast command of every part 
to live and die for thee 








love not me for comely grace 
for my pleasing eye or face 
nor for any outward part 
no nor for a constant heart --
for these may fail or turn to ill 
so thou and i shall sever 
keep therefore a true woman's eye 
and love me still but know not why--
so hast thou the same reason still
to doat upon me ever 








not celia that i juster am
or better than the rest 
for i would change each hour like them 
were not my heart at rest 

but i am tied to very thee
by every thought i have 
thy face i only care to see 
thy heart i only crave 

all that in woman is adored
in thy dear self i find--
for the whole sex can but afford
the handsome and the kind 

why then should i seek further store 
and still make love anew 
when change itself can give no more 
'tis easy to be true 








when love with unconfin d wings
hovers within my gates 
and my divine althea brings
to whisper at the grates 
when i lie tangled in her hair
and fetter'd to her eye 
the birds that wanton in the air
know no such liberty 

when flowing cups run swiftly round
with no allaying thames 
our careless heads with roses crown'd 
our hearts with loyal flames 
when thirsty grief in wine we steep 
when healths and draughts go free--
fishes that tipple in the deep
know no such liberty 

when linnet-like confin d i
with shriller throat shall sing
the sweetness mercy majesty 
and glories of my king 
when i shall voice aloud how good
he is how great should be 
enlarg d winds that curl the flood 
know no such liberty 

stone walls do not a prison make 
nor iron bars a cage 
minds innocent and quiet take
that for an hermitage 
if i have freedom in my love
and in my soul am free 
angels alone that soar above 
enjoy such liberty 








if to be absent were to be
away from thee 
or that when i am gone
you or i were alone 
then my lucasta might i crave
pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave 

though seas and land betwixt us both 
our faith and troth 
like separated souls 
all time and space controls 
above the highest sphere we meet
unseen unknown and greet as angels greet 

so then we do anticipate
our after-fate 
and are alive i' the skies 
if thus our lips and eyes
can speak like spirits unconfined
in heaven their earthy bodies left behind 








why so pale and wan fond lover 
prythee why so pale 
will if looking well can't move her 
looking ill prevail 
prythee why so pale 

why so dull and mute young sinner 
prythee why so mute 
will when speaking well can't win her 
saying nothing do't 
prythee why so mute 

quit quit for shame this will not move 
this cannot take her 
if of herself she will not love 
nothing can make her 
the d----l take her 








awake awake my lyre 
and tell thy silent master's humble tale
in sounds that may prevail 
sounds that gentle thoughts inspire 
though so exalted she
and i so lowly be
tell her such different notes make all thy harmony 

hark how the strings awake 
and though the moving hand approach not near 
themselves with awful fear
a kind of numerous trembling make 
now all thy forces try 
now all thy charms apply 
revenge upon her ear the conquests of her eye 

weak lyre thy virtue sure
is useless here since thou art only found
to cure but not to wound 
and she to wound but not to cure 
too weak too wilt thou prove
my passion to remove 
physic to other ills thou'rt nourishment to love 

sleep sleep again my lyre 
for thou canst never tell my humble tale
in sounds that will prevail 
nor gentle thoughts in her inspire 
all thy vain mirth lay by 
bid thy strings silent lie 
sleep sleep again my lyre and let thy master die 








shall i wasting in despair 
die because a woman's fair 
or my cheeks make pale with care
'cause another's rosy are 
be she fairer than the day 
or the flowery meads in may--
if she be not so to me 
what care i how fair she be 

shall my foolish heart be pined
'cause i see a woman kind 
or a well dispos d nature
join d with a lovely feature 
be she meeker kinder than
turtle-dove or pelican 
if she be not so to me 
what care i how kind she be 

shall a woman's virtues move
me to perish for her love 
or her merit's value known
make me quite forget my own 
be she with that goodness blest
which may gain her name of best 
if she be not such to me 
what care i how good she be 

'cause her fortune seems too high 
shall i play the fool and die 
those that bear a noble mind
where they want of riches find 
think what with them they would do
who without them dare to woo 
and unless that mind i see 
what care i how great she be 

great or good or kind or fair 
i will ne'er the more despair 
if she love me this believe 
i will die ere she shall grieve 
if she slight me when i woo 
i can scorn and let her go 
for if she be not for me 
what care i for whom she be 








hence all you vain delights 
as short as are the nights
wherein you spend your folly
there's naught in this life sweet
if men were wise to see't 
but only melancholy 
o sweetest melancholy 
welcome folded arms and fix d eyes 
a sigh that piercing mortifies 
a look that's fasten'd to the ground 
a tongue chain'd up without a sound 
fountain-heads and pathless groves 
places which pale passion loves 
moonlight walks when all the fowls
are warmly housed save bats and owls 
a midnight bell a parting groan 
these are the sounds we feed upon 
then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley 
nothing's so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy 








thy hue dear pledge is pure and bright
as in that well-remember'd night
when first thy mystic braid was wove 
and first my agnes whisper'd love 

since then how often hast thou prest
the torrid zone of this wild breast 
whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell
with the first sin that peopled hell 
a breast whose blood's a troubled ocean 
each throb the earthquake's wild commotion 
o if such clime thou canst endure
yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure 
what conquest o'er each erring thought
of that fierce realm had agnes wrought 
i had not wander'd far and wide
with such an angel for my guide 
nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me
if she had lived and lived to love me 

not then this world's wild joys had been
to me one savage hunting scene 
my sole delight the headlong race 
and frantic hurry of the chase 
to start pursue and bring to bay 
rush in drag down and rend my prey 
then--from the carcase turn away 
mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed 
and soothed each wound which pride inflamed --
yes god and man might now approve me
if thou hadst lived and lived to love me 








o waly waly up the bank 
and waly waly down the brae 
and waly waly yon burn-side
where i and my love wont to gae 
i leant my back unto an aik 
i thought it was a trusty tree 
but first it bow'd and syne it brak 
sae my true love did lichtly me 

o waly waly but love be bonny
a little time while it is new 
but when 'tis auld it waxeth cauld 
and fades awa' like morning dew 
o wherefore should i busk my head 
or wherefore should i kame my hair 
for my true love has me forsook 
and says he'll never loe me mair 

now arthur-seat sall be my bed 
the sheets sall ne'er be prest by me 
saint anton's well sall be my drink 
since my true love has forsaken me 
marti'mas wind when wilt thou blaw
and shake the green leaves aff the tree 
o gentle death when wilt thou come 
for of my life i am wear e 

'tis not the frost that freezes fell 
nor blawing snaw's inclemencie 
'tis not sic cauld that makes me cry 
but my love's heart grown cauld to me 
when we came in by glasgow town
we were a comely sight to see 
my love was clad in the black velv t 
and i mysell in cramasie 

but had i wist before i kist 
that love had been sae ill to win 
i had lockt my heart in a case of gowd
and pinn'd it wi' a siller pin 
and o if my young babe were born 
and set upon the nurse's knee 
and i mysell were dead and gane 
and the green grass growing over me 








i wish i were where helen lies 
night and day on me she cries 
o that i were where helen lies
on fair kirconnell lea 

curst be the heart that thought the thought 
and curst the hand that fired the shot 
when in my arms burd helen dropt 
and died to succour me 

o think na but my heart was sair 
when my love dropt down and spak nae mair 
i laid her down wi' meikle care 
on fair kirconnell lea 

as i went down the water side 
none but my foe to be my guide 
none but my foe to be my guide 
on fair kirconnell lea 

i lighted down my sword to draw 
i hack d him in pieces sma' 
i hack d him in pieces sma' 
for her sake that died for me 

o helen fair beyond compare 
i'll make a garland of thy hair
shall bind my heart for evermair
until the day i die 

o that i were where helen lies 
night and day on me she cries 
out of my bed she bids me rise 
says haste and come to me 

o helen fair o helen chaste 
if i were with thee i were blest 
where thou lies low and takes thy rest
on fair kirconnell lea 

i wish my grave were growing green 
a winding-sheet drawn ower my een 
and i in helen's arms lying 
on fair kirconnell lea 

i wish i were where helen lies 
night and day on me she cries 
and i am weary of the skies 
since my love died for me 








as i was walking all alane
i heard twa corbies making a mane 
the tane unto the t'other say 
 where sall we gang and dine to-day 

 --in behint yon auld fail dyke 
i wot there lies a new-slain knight 
and naebody kens that he lies there 
but his hawk his hound and lady fair 

 his hound is to the hunting gane 
his hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame 
his lady's ta'en another mate 
so we may mak our dinner sweet 

 ye'll sit on his white hause-bane 
and i'll pick out his bonny blue een 
wi' ae lock o' his gowden hair
we'll theek our nest when it grows bare 

 mony a one for him makes mane 
but nane sall ken where he is gane 
o'er his white banes when they are bare 
the wind sall blaw for evermair 








fair pledges of a fruitful tree 
why do ye fall so fast 
your date is not so past 
but you may stay yet here awhile
to blush and gently smile 
and go at last 

what were ye born to be
an hour or half's delight 
and so to bid good-night 
'twas pity nature brought ye forth 
merely to show your worth 
and lose you quite 

but you are lovely leaves where we
may read how soon things have
their end though ne'er so brave 
and after they have shown their pride
like you awhile they glide
into the grave 








fair daffodils we weep to see
you haste away so soon
as yet the early-rising sun
has not attain'd his noon 
stay stay 
until the hasting day
has run
but to the even-song 
and having pray'd together we
will go with you along 

we have short time to stay as you 
we have as short a spring 
as quick a growth to meet decay
as you or any thing 
we die
as your hours do and dry
away
like to the summer's rain 
or as the pearls of morning's dew
ne'er to be found again 








how vainly men themselves amaze
to win the palm the oak or bays 
and their incessant labours see
crown'd from some single herb or tree 
whose short and narrow-verg d shade
does prudently their toils upbraid 
while all the flowers and trees do close
to weave the garlands of repose 

fair quiet have i found thee here 
and innocence thy sister dear 
mistaken long i sought you then
in busy companies of men 
your sacred plants if here below 
only among the plants will grow 
society is all but rude
to this delicious solitude 

no white nor red was ever seen
so amorous as this lovely green 
fond lovers cruel as their flame 
cut in these trees their mistress' name 
little alas they know or heed
how far these beauties hers exceed 
fair trees where'er your barks i wound 
no name shall but your own be found 

when we have run our passions' heat 
love hither makes his best retreat 
the gods who mortal beauty chase 
still in a tree did end their race 
apollo hunted daphne so
only that she might laurel grow 
and pan did after syrinx speed
not as a nymph but for a reed 

what wondrous life in this i lead 
ripe apples drop about my head 
the luscious clusters of the vine
upon my mouth do crush their wine 
the nectarine and curious peach
into my hands themselves do reach 
stumbling on melons as i pass 
ensnared with flowers i fall on grass 

meanwhile the mind from pleasure less
withdraws into its happiness 
the mind that ocean where each kind
does straight its own resemblance find 
yet it creates transcending these 
far other worlds and other seas 
annihilating all that's made
to a green thought in a green shade 

here at the fountain's sliding foot
or at some fruit-tree's mossy root 
casting the body's vest aside
my soul into the boughs does glide 
there like a bird it sits and sings 
then whets and claps its silver wings 
and till prepared for longer flight 
waves in its plumes the various light 

such was that happy garden-state
while man there walk'd without a mate 
after a place so pure and sweet 
what other help could yet be meet 
but 'twas beyond a mortal's share
to wander solitary there 
two paradises are in one 
to live in paradise alone 

how well the skilful gardener drew
of flowers and herbs this dial new 
where from above the milder sun
does through a fragrant zodiac run 
and as it works th' industrious bee
computes its time as well as we 
how could such sweet and wholesome hours
be reckon'd but with herbs and flowers 








hence loath d melancholy 
of cerberus and blackest midnight born
in stygian cave forlorn
'mongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy 
find out some uncouth cell
where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings
and the night-raven sings 
there under ebon shades and low-browed rocks
as ragged as thy locks 
in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell 

but come thou goddess fair and free 
in heaven yclept euphrosyne 
and by men heart-easing mirth 
whom lovely venus at a birth
with two sister graces more
to ivy-crown d bacchus bore 
or whether as some sager sing 
the frolic wind that breathes the spring
zephyr with aurora playing 
as he met her once a-maying--
there on beds of violets blue
and fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew
fill'd her with thee a daughter fair 
so buxom blithe and debonair 
haste thee nymph and bring with thee
jest and youthful jollity 
quips and cranks and wanton wiles 
nods and becks and wreath d smiles
such as hang on hebe's cheek 
and love to live in dimple sleek 
sport that wrinkled care derides 
and laughter holding both his sides --
come and trip it as you go
on the light fantastic toe 
and in thy right hand lead with thee
the mountain-nymph sweet liberty 
and if i give thee honour due 
mirth admit me of thy crew 
to live with her and live with thee 
in unreprov d pleasures free 
to hear the lark begin his flight
and singing startle the dull night
from his watch-tower in the skies 
till the dappled dawn doth rise 
then to come in spite of sorrow 
and at my window bid good-morrow 
through the sweetbriar or the vine 
or the twisted eglantine 
while the cock with lively din 
scatters the rear of darkness thin 
and to the stack or the barn-door 
stoutly struts his dames before 
oft listening how the hounds and horn
cheerly rouse the slumbering morn 
from the side of some hoar hill 
through the high wood echoing shrill 
sometime walking not unseen 
by hedgerow elms on hillocks green 
right against the eastern gate
where the great sun begins his state
robed in flames and amber light 
the clouds in thousand liveries dight 
while the ploughman near at hand 
whistles o'er the furrow'd land 
and the milkmaid singeth blithe 
and the mower whets his scythe 
and every shepherd tells his tale
under the hawthorn in the dale 
straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures
whilst the landscape round it measures 
russet lawns and fallows gray 
where the nibbling flocks do stray 
mountains on whose barren breast
the labouring clouds do often rest 
meadows trim with daisies pied 
shallow brooks and rivers wide 
towers and battlements it sees
bosom'd high in tufted trees 
where perhaps some beauty lies 
the cynosure of neighbouring eyes 
hard by a cottage chimney smokes
from betwixt two aged oaks 
where corydon and thyrsis met
are at their savoury dinner set
of herbs and other country messes 
which the neat-handed phyllis dresses 
and then in haste her bower she leaves
with thestylis to bind the sheaves 
or if the earlier season lead 
to the tann'd haycock in the mead 
sometimes with secure delight
the upland hamlets will invite 
when the merry bells ring round 
and the jocund rebecks sound
to many a youth and many a maid 
dancing in the chequer'd shade 
and young and old come forth to play
on a sun-shine holy-day 
till the live-long day-light fail 
then to the spicy nut-brown ale 
with stories told of many a feat 
how faery mab the junkets eat 
she was pinch'd and pull'd she said 
and he by friar's lantern led 
tells how the drudging goblin sweat
to earn his cream-bowl duly set 
when in one night ere glimpse of morn 
his shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn
that ten day-labourers could not end 
then lies him down the lubber fiend 
and stretch'd out all the chimney's length 
basks at the fire his hairy strength 
and crop-full out of doors he flings 
ere the first cock his matin rings 
thus done the tales to bed they creep 
by whispering winds soon lull'd asleep 
tower'd cities please us then 
and the busy hum of men 
where throngs of knights and barons bold 
in weeds of peace high triumphs hold 
with store of ladies whose bright eyes
rain influence and judge the prize
of wit or arms while both contend
to win her grace whom all commend 
there let hymen oft appear
in saffron robe with taper clear 
and pomp and feast and revelry 
with mask and antique pageantry 
such sights as youthful poets dream
on summer eves by haunted stream 
then to the well-trod stage anon 
if jonson's learned sock be on 
or sweetest shakspeare fancy's child 
warble his native wood-notes wild 
and ever against eating cares 
lap me in soft lydian airs
married to immortal verse 
such as the meeting soul may pierce
in notes with many a winding bout
of link d sweetness long drawn out 
with wanton heed and giddy cunning
the melting voice through mazes running 
untwisting all the chains that tie
the hidden soul of harmony 
that orpheus' self may heave his head
from golden slumber on a bed
of heap'd elysian flowers and hear
such strains as would have won the ear
of pluto to have quite set free
his half-regain'd eurydice 
these delights if thou canst give 
mirth with thee i mean to live 








hence vain deluding joys 
the brood of folly without father bred 
how little you bestead
or fill the fix d mind with all your toys 
dwell in some idle brain 
and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess
as thick and numberless
as the gay motes that people the sunbeams 
or likest hovering dreams
the fickle pensioners of morpheus' train 

but hail thou goddess sage and holy 
hail divinest melancholy 
whose saintly visage is too bright
to hit the sense of human sight 
and therefore to our weaker view
o'erlaid with black staid wisdom's hue 
black but such as in esteem
prince memnon's sister might beseem 
or that starr'd ethiop queen that strove
to set her beauty's praise above
the sea-nymphs and their powers offended 
yet thou art higher far descended 
thee bright-hair'd vesta long of yore 
to solitary saturn bore 
his daughter she in saturn's reign
such mixture was not held a stain 
oft in glimmering bowers and glades
he met her and in secret shades
of woody ida's inmost grove 
whilst yet there was no fear of jove 
come pensive nun devout and pure 
sober steadfast and demure 
all in a robe of darkest grain
flowing with majestic train 
and sable stole of cypres lawn
over thy decent shoulders drawn 
come but keep thy wonted state 
with even step and musing gait 
and looks commercing with the skies 
thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes 
there held in holy passion still 
forget thyself to marble till
with a sad leaden downward cast
thou fix them on the earth as fast 
and join with thee calm peace and quiet 
spare fast that oft with gods doth diet 
and hears the muses in a ring
aye round about jove's altar sing 
and add to these retired leisure
that in trim gardens takes his pleasure --
but first and chiefest with thee bring
him that yon soars on golden wing 
guiding the fiery-wheel d throne 
the cherub contemplati n 
and the mute silence hist along 
'less philomel will deign a song 
in her sweetest saddest plight 
smoothing the rugged brow of night 
while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
gently o'er the accustom'd oak 
--sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly 
most musical most melancholy 
thee chauntress oft the woods among
i woo to hear thy even-song 
and missing thee i walk unseen
on the dry smooth-shaven green 
to behold the wandering moon 
riding near her highest noon 
like one that had been led astray
through the heaven's wide pathless way 
and oft as if her head she bow'd 
stooping through a fleecy cloud 
oft on a plat of rising ground
i hear the far-off curfeu sound 
over some wide-water'd shore 
swinging slow with sullen roar 
or if the air will not permit 
some still remov d place will fit 
where glowing embers through the room
teach light to counterfeit a gloom 
far from all resort of mirth 
save the cricket on the hearth 
or the bellman's drowsy charm
to bless the doors from nightly harm 
or let my lamp at midnight hour
be seen in some high lonely tower 
where i may oft out-watch the bear 
with thrice-great hermes or unsphere
the spirit of plato to unfold
what worlds or what vast regions hold
the immortal mind that hath forsook
her mansion in this fleshy nook 
and of those demons that are found
in fire air flood or under ground 
whose power hath a true consent
with planet or with element 
sometime let gorgeous tragedy
in sceptr'd pall come sweeping by
presenting thebes or pelops' line 
or the tale of troy divine 
or what though rare of later age
ennobled hath the buskin'd stage 
but o sad virgin that thy power
might raise musaeus from his bower 
or bid the soul of orpheus sing
such notes as warbled to the string 
drew iron tears down pluto's cheek
and made hell grant what love did seek 
or call up him that left half-told
the story of cambuscan bold 
of camball and of algarsife 
and who had canac to wife
that own'd the virtuous ring and glass 
and of the wondrous horse of brass
on which the tartar king did ride 
and if aught else great bards beside
in sage and solemn tunes have sung
of tourneys and of trophies hung 
of forests and enchantments drear 
where more is meant than meets the ear 
thus night oft see me in thy pale career 
till civil-suited morn appear 
not trick'd and frounced as she was wont
with the attic boy to hunt 
but kercheft in a comely cloud
while rocking winds are piping loud 
or usher'd with a shower still 
when the gust hath blown his fill 
ending on the rustling leaves
with minute drops from off the eaves 
and when the sun begins to fling
his flaring beams me goddess bring
to arch d walks of twilight groves 
and shadows brown that sylvan loves 
of pine or monumental oak 
where the rude axe with heav d stroke 
was never heard the nymphs to daunt
or fright them from their hallow'd haunt 
there in close covert by some brook
where no profaner eye may look 
hide me from day's garish eye 
while the bee with honey'd thigh 
that at her flowery work doth sing 
and the waters murmuring 
with such consort as they keep
entice the dewy-feather'd sleep 
and let some strange mysterious dream
wave at his wings in aery stream
of lively portraiture display'd 
softly on my eyelids laid 
and as i wake sweet music breathe
above about or underneath 
sent by some spirit to mortals good 
or the unseen genius of the wood 
but let my due feet never fail
to walk the studious cloister's pale 
and love the high-embow d roof 
with antique pillars massy proof 
and storied windows richly dight
casting a dim religious light 
there let the pealing organ blow
to the full-voiced quire below
in service high and anthems clear 
as may with sweetness through mine ear 
dissolve me into ecstasies 
and bring all heaven before mine eyes 
and may at last my weary age
find out the peaceful hermitage 
the hairy gown and mossy cell 
where i may sit and rightly spell
of every star that heaven doth show 
and every herb that sips the dew 
till old experience do attain
to something like prophetic strain 

these pleasures melancholy give 
and i with thee will choose to live 








where the remote bermudas ride
in the ocean's bosom unespied 
from a small boat that row'd along
the listening woods received this song 

 what should we do but sing his praise
that led us through the watery maze
where he the huge sea-monsters wracks 
that lift the deep upon their backs 
unto an isle so long unknown 
and yet far kinder than our own 
he lands us on a grassy stage 
safe from the storms and prelate's rage 
he gave us this eternal spring
which here enamels everything 
and sends the fowls to us in care
on daily visits through the air 
he hangs in shades the orange bright
like golden lamps in a green night 
and does in the pomegranates close
jewels more rich than ormus shows 
he makes the figs our mouths to meet 
and throws the melons at our feet 
but apples plants of such a price 
no tree could ever bear them twice 
with cedars chosen by his hand
from lebanon he stores the land 
and makes the hollow seas that roar
proclaim the ambergris on shore 
he cast of which we rather boast 
the gospel's pearl upon our coast 
and in these rocks for us did frame
a temple where to sound his name 
o let our voice his praise exalt
till it arrive at heaven's vault 
which then perhaps rebounding may
echo beyond the mexique bay 
--thus sung they in the english boat
a holy and a cheerful note 
and all the way to guide their chime 
with falling oars they kept the time 








blest pair of sirens pledges of heaven's joy 
sphere-born harmonious sisters voice and verse 
wed your divine sounds and mixt power employ
dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce 
and to our high-raised phantasy present
that undisturb d song of pure concent 
ay sung before the sapphire-colour'd throne
to him that sits thereon 
with saintly shout and solemn jubilee 
where the bright seraphim in burning row
their loud uplifted angel-trumpets blow 
and the cherubic host in thousand quires
touch their immortal harps of golden wires 
with those just spirits that wear victorious palms
hymns devout and holy psalms
singing everlastingly 
that we on earth with undiscording voice
may rightly answer that melodious noise 
as once we did till disproportion'd sin
jarr'd against nature's chime and with harsh din
broke the fair music that all creatures made
to their great lord whose love their motion sway'd
in perfect diapason whilst they stood
in first obedience and their state of good 
o may we soon again renew that song 
and keep in tune with heaven till god ere long
to his celestial consort us unite 
to live with him and sing in endless morn of light 








'twas at the royal feast for persia won
by philip's warlike son--
aloft in awful state
the godlike hero sate
on his imperial throne 
his valiant peers were placed around 
their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
 so should desert in arms be crown'd 
the lovely thais by his side
sate like a blooming eastern bride
in flower of youth and beauty's pride --
happy happy happy pair 
none but the brave
none but the brave
none but the brave deserves the fair 

timotheus placed on high
amid the tuneful quire
with flying fingers touch'd the lyre 
the trembling notes ascend the sky
and heavenly joys inspire 
the song began from jove
who left his blissful seats above--
such is the power of mighty love 
a dragon's fiery form belied the god 
sublime on radiant spires he rode
when he to fair olympia prest 
and while he sought her snowy breast 
then round her slender waist he curl'd 
and stamp'd an image of himself a sovereign of the world 
--the listening crowd admire the lofty sound 
a present deity they shout around 
a present deity the vaulted roofs rebound 
with ravish'd ears
the monarch hears 
assumes the god 
affects to nod
and seems to shake the spheres 

the praise of bacchus then the sweet musician sung 
of bacchus ever fair and ever young 
the jolly god in triumph comes 
sound the trumpets beat the drums 
flush'd with a purple grace
he shows his honest face 
now give the hautboys breath he comes he comes 
bacchus ever fair and young 
drinking joys did first ordain 
bacchus' blessings are a treasure 
drinking is the soldier's pleasure 
rich the treasure 
sweet the pleasure 
sweet is pleasure after pain 

soothed with the sound the king grew vain 
fought all his battles o'er again 
and thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain 
the master saw the madness rise 
his glowing cheeks his ardent eyes 
and while he heaven and earth defied
changed his hand and check'd his pride 
he chose a mournful muse
soft pity to infuse 
he sung darius great and good 
by too severe a fate
fallen fallen fallen fallen 
fallen from his high estate 
and weltering in his blood 
deserted at his utmost need 
by those his former bounty fed 
on the bare earth exposed he lies
with not a friend to close his eyes 
--with downcast looks the joyless victor sate 
revolving in his alter'd soul
the various turns of chance below 
and now and then a sigh he stole 
and tears began to flow 

the mighty master smiled to see
that love was in the next degree 
'twas but a kindred-sound to move 
for pity melts the mind to love 
softly sweet in lydian measures 
soon he soothed his soul to pleasures 
war he sung is toil and trouble 
honour but an empty bubble 
never ending still beginning 
fighting still and still destroying 
if the world be worth thy winning 
think o think it worth enjoying 
lovely thais sits beside thee 
take the good the gods provide thee 
--the many rend the skies with loud applause 
so love was crown'd but music won the cause 
the prince unable to conceal his pain 
gazed on the fair
who caused his care 
and sigh'd and look'd sigh'd and look'd 
sigh'd and look'd and sigh'd again 
at length with love and wine at once opprest
the vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast 

now strike the golden lyre again 
a louder yet and yet a louder strain 
break his bands of sleep asunder 
and rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder 
hark hark the horrid sound
has raised up his head 
as awaked from the dead 
and amazed he stares around 
revenge revenge timotheus cries 
see the furies arise 
see the snakes that they rear
how they hiss in their hair 
and the sparkles that flash from their eyes 
behold a ghastly band
each a torch in his hand 
those are grecian ghosts that in battle were slain
and unburied remain
inglorious on the plain 
give the vengeance due
to the valiant crew 
behold how they toss their torches on high 
how they point to the persian abodes
and glittering temples of their hostile gods 
--the princes applaud with a furious joy 
and the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy 
thais led the way 
to light him to his prey 
and like another helen fired another troy 

--thus long ago 
ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow 
while organs yet were mute 
timotheus to his breathing flute
and sounding lyre
could swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire 
at last divine cecilia came 
inventress of the vocal frame 
the sweet enthusiast from her sacred store
enlarged the former narrow bounds 
and added length to solemn sounds 
with nature's mother-wit and arts unknown before 
--let old timotheus yield the prize
or both divide the crown 
he raised a mortal to the skies 
she drew an angel down 













it is more difficult to characterise the english poetry of the
eighteenth century than that of any other for it was an age not only of
spontaneous transition but of bold experiment it includes not only
such divergences of thought as distinguished the rape of the lock from
the parish register but such vast contemporaneous differences as lie
between pope and collins burns and cowper yet we may clearly trace
three leading moods or tendencies --the aspects of courtly or educated
life represented by pope and carried to exhaustion by his followers the
poetry of nature and of man viewed through a cultivated and at the
same time an impassioned frame of mind by collins and gray --lastly the
study of vivid and simple narrative including natural description 
begun by gay and thomson pursued by burns and others in the north and
established in england by goldsmith percy crabbe and cowper great
varieties in style accompanied these diversities in aim poets could not
always distinguish the manner suitable for subjects so far apart and
the union of the language of courtly and of common life exhibited most
conspicuously by burns has given a tone to the poetry of that century
which is better explained by reference to its historical origin than by
naming it in the common criticism of our day artificial there is
again a nobleness of thought a courageous aim at high and in a strict
sense manly excellence in many of the writers --nor can that period be
justly termed tame and wanting in originality which produced poems such
as pope's satires gray's odes and elegy the ballads of gay and carey 
the songs of burns and cowper in truth poetry at this as at all times
was a more or less unconscious mirror of the genius of the age and the
brave and admirable spirit of enquiry which made the eighteenth century
the turning-time in european civilisation is reflected faithfully in its
verse an intelligent reader will find the influence of newton as
markedly in the poems of pope as of elizabeth in the plays of
shakespeare on this great subject however these indications must here
be sufficient 






now the golden morn aloft
waves her dew-bespangled wing 
with vermeil cheek and whisper soft
she woos the tardy spring 
till april starts and calls around
the sleeping fragrance from the ground 
and lightly o'er the living scene
scatters his freshest tenderest green 

new-born flocks in rustic dance 
frisking ply their feeble feet 
forgetful of their wintry trance
the birds his presence greet 
but chief the sky-lark warbles high
his trembling thrilling ecstasy 
and lessening from the dazzled sight 
melts into air and liquid light 

yesterday the sullen year
saw the snowy whirlwind fly 
mute was the music of the air 
the herd stood drooping by 
their raptures now that wildly flow
no yesterday nor morrow know 
'tis man alone that joy descries
with forward and reverted eyes 

smiles on past misfortune's brow
soft reflection's hand can trace 
and o'er the cheek of sorrow throw
a melancholy grace 
while hope prolongs our happier hour 
or deepest shades that dimly lour
and blacken round our weary way 
gilds with a gleam of distant day 

still where rosy pleasure leads 
see a kindred grief pursue 
behind the steps that misery treads
approaching comfort view 
the hues of bliss more brightly glow
chastised by sabler tints of woe 
and blended form with artful strife 
the strength and harmony of life 

see the wretch that long has tost
on the thorny bed of pain 
at length repair his vigour lost
and breathe and walk again 
the meanest floweret of the vale 
the simplest note that swells the gale 
the common sun the air the skies 
to him are opening paradise 








happy the man whose wish and care
a few paternal acres bound 
content to breathe his native air
in his own ground 

whose herds with milk whose fields with bread 
whose flocks supply him with attire 
whose trees in summer yield him shade
in winter fire 

blest who can unconcern'dly find
hours days and years slide soft away
in health of body peace of mind 
quiet by day 

sound sleep by night study and ease
together mix'd sweet recreation 
and innocence which most does please
with meditation 

thus let me live unseen unknown 
thus unlamented let me die 
steal from the world and not a stone
tell where i lie 








o say what is that thing call'd light 
which i must ne'er enjoy 
what are the blessings of the sight 
o tell your poor blind boy 

you talk of wondrous things you see 
you say the sun shines bright 
i feel him warm but how can he
or make it day or night 

my day or night myself i make
whene'er i sleep or play 
and could i ever keep awake
with me 'twere always day 

with heavy sighs i often hear
you mourn my hapless woe 
but sure with patience i can bear
a loss i ne'er can know 

then let not what i cannot have
my cheer of mind destroy 
whilst thus i sing i am a king 
although a poor blind boy 








'twas on a lofty vase's side
where china's gayest art had dyed
the azure flowers that blow 
demurest of the tabby kind
the pensive selima reclined 
gazed on the lake below 

her conscious tail her joy declared 
the fair round face the snowy beard 
the velvet of her paws 
her coat that with the tortoise vies 
her ears of jet and emerald eyes--
she saw and purr'd applause 

still had she gazed but 'midst the tide
two angel forms were seen to glide 
the genii of the stream 
their scaly armour's tyrian hue
through richest purple to the view
betray'd a golden gleam 

the hapless nymph with wonder saw 
a whisker first and then a claw
with many an ardent wish
she stretch'd in vain to reach the prize--
what female heart can gold despise 
what cat's averse to fish 

presumptuous maid with looks intent
again she stretch'd again she bent 
nor knew the gulf between--
malignant fate sat by and smiled--
the slippery verge her feet beguiled 
she tumbled headlong in 

eight times emerging from the flood 
she mew'd to every watery god
some speedy aid to send --
no dolphin came no nereid stirr'd 
nor cruel tom nor susan heard--
a favourite has no friend 

from hence ye beauties undeceived
know one false step is ne'er retrieved 
and be with caution bold 
not all that tempts your wandering eyes
and heedless hearts is lawful prize 
nor all that glisters gold 








timely blossom infant fair 
fondling of a happy pair 
every morn and every night
their solicitous delight 
sleeping waking still at ease 
pleasing without skill to please
little gossip blithe and hale 
tattling many a broken tale 
singing many a tuneless song 
lavish of a heedless tongue 
simple maiden void of art 
babbling out the very heart 
yet abandon'd to thy will 
yet imagining no ill 
yet too innocent to blush 
like the linnet in the bush
to the mother-linnet's note
moduling her slender throat 
chirping forth thy petty joys 
wanton in the change of toys 
like the linnet green in may
flitting to each bloomy spray 
wearied then and glad of rest 
like the linnet in the nest --
this thy present happy lot
this in time will be forgot 
other pleasures other cares 
ever-busy time prepares 
and thou shalt in thy daughter see 
this picture once resembled thee 








when britain first at heaven's command
arose from out the azure main 
this was the charter of her land 
and guardian angels sung the strain 
rule brittania brittania rules the waves 
britons never shall be slaves 

the nations not so blest as thee
must in their turn to tyrants fall 
whilst thou shalt flourish great and free
the dread and envy of them all 

still more majestic shalt thou rise 
more dreadful from each foreign stroke 
as the loud blast that tears the skies
serves but to root thy native oak 

thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame 
all their attempts to bend thee down
will but arouse thy generous flame 
and work their woe and thy renown 

to thee belongs the rural reign 
thy cities shall with commerce shine 
all thine shall be the subject main 
and every shore it circles thine 

the muses still with freedom found 
shall to thy happy coast repair 
blest isle with matchless beauty crown'd 
and manly hearts to guard the fair --
rule britannia brittania rules the waves 
britons never shall be slaves 








 pindaric ode 

 ruin seize thee ruthless king 
confusion on thy banners wait 
tho' fann'd by conquest's crimson wing
they mock the air with idle state 
helm nor hauberk's twisted mail
nor e'en thy virtues tyrant shall avail
to save thy secret soul from nightly fears 
from cambria's curse from cambria's tears 
--such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride
of the first edward scatter'd wild dismay 
as down the steep of snowdon's shaggy side
he wound with toilsome march his long array --
stout glo'ster stood aghast in speechless trance 
 to arms cried mortimer and couch'd quivering lance 

on a rock whose haughty brow
frowns o'er old conway's foaming flood 
robed in the sable garb of woe
with haggard eyes the poet stood 
 loose his beard and hoary hair
stream'd like a meteor to the troubled air 
and with a master's hand and prophet's fire
struck the deep sorrows of his lyre 
 hark how each giant oak and desert-cave
sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath 
o'er thee o king their hundred arms they wave 
revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe 
vocal no more since cambria's fatal day 
to high-born hoel's harp or soft llewellyn's lay 

 cold is cadwallo's tongue
that hush'd the stormy main 
brave urien sleeps upon his craggy bed 
mountains ye mourn in vain
modred whose magic song
made huge plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head 
on dreary arvon's shore they lie
smear'd with gore and ghastly pale 
far far aloof the affrighted ravens sail 
the famish'd eagle screams and passes by 
dear lost companions of my tuneful art 
dear as the light that visits these sad eyes 
dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart 
ye died amidst your dying country's cries--
no more i weep they do not sleep 
on yonder cliffs a griesly band 
i see them sit they linger yet 
avengers of their native land 
with me in dreadful harmony they join 
and weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line 

 weave the warp and weave the woof
the winding-sheet of edward's race 
give ample room and verge enough
the characters of hell to trace 
mark the year and mark the night
when severn shall re-echo with affright
the shrieks of death thro' berkley's roof that ring 
shrieks of an agonising king 
she-wolf of france with unrelenting fangs
that tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate 
from thee be born who o'er thy country hangs
the scourge of heaven what terrors round him wait 
amazement in his van with flight combined 
and sorrow's faded form and solitude behind 

 mighty victor mighty lord 
low on his funeral couch he lies 
no pitying heart no eye afford
a tear to grace his obsequies 
is the sable warrior fled 
thy son is gone he rests among the dead 
the swarm that in thy noon-tide beam were born 
--gone to salute the rising morn 
fair laughs the morn and soft the zephyr blows 
while proudly riding o'er the azure realm
in gallant trim the gilded vessel goes 
youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm 
regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway 
that hush'd in grim repose expects his evening prey 

 fill high the sparkling bowl 
the rich repast prepare 
reft of a crown he yet may share the feast 
close by the regal chair
fell thirst and famine scowl
a baleful smile upon their baffled guest 
heard ye the din of battle bray 
lance to lance and horse to horse 
long years of havock urge their destined course 
and thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way 
ye towers of julius london's lasting shame 
with many a foul and midnight murder fed 
revere his consort's faith his father's fame 
and spare the meek usurper's holy head 
above below the rose of snow 
twined with her blushing foe we spread 
the bristled boar in infant gore
wallows beneath the thorny shade 
now brothers bending o'er the accurs d loom 
stamp we our vengeance deep and ratify his doom 

 edward lo to sudden fate
 weave we the woof the thread is spun 
half of thy heart we consecrate 
 the web is wove the work is done 
stay o stay nor thus forlorn
leave me unbless'd unpitied here to mourn 
in yon bright track that fires the western skies
they melt they vanish from my eyes 
but o what solemn scenes on snowdon's height
descending slow their glittering skirts unroll 
visions of glory spare my aching sight 
ye unborn ages crowd not on my soul 
no more our long-lost arthur we bewail --
all hail ye genuine kings britannia's issue hail 

 girt with many a baron bold 
sublime their starry fronts they rear 
and gorgeous dames and statesmen old
in bearded majesty appear 
in the midst a form divine 
her eye proclaims her of the briton-line 
her lion-port her awe-commanding face
attemper'd sweet to virgin-grace 
what strings symphonious tremble in the air 
what strains of vocal transport round her play 
hear from the grave great taliessin hear 
they breathe a soul to animate thy clay 
bright rapture calls and soaring as she sings 
waves in the eye of heaven her many-colour'd wings 

 the verse adorn again 
fierce war and faithful love 
and truth severe by fairy fiction drest 
in buskin'd measures move
pale grief and pleasing pain 
with horror tyrant of the throbbing breast 
a voice as of the cherub-choir
gales from blooming eden bear 
and distant warblings lessen on my ear
that lost in long futurity expire 
fond impious man think'st thou yon sanguine cloud
raised by thy breath has quench'd the orb of day 
to-morrow he repairs the golden flood
and warms the nations with redoubled ray 
enough for me with joy i see
the different doom our fates assign 
be thine despair and sceptred care 
to triumph and to die are mine 
he spoke and headlong from the mountain's height
deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night 








how sleep the brave who sink to rest
by all their country's wishes blest 
when spring with dewy fingers cold 
returns to deck their hallow'd mould 
she there shall dress a sweeter sod
than fancy's feet have ever trod 

by fairy hands their knell is rung 
by forms unseen their dirge is sung 
there honour comes a pilgrim gray 
to bless the turf that wraps their clay 
and freedom shall awhile repair
to dwell a weeping hermit there 








the lovely lass o' inverness 
nae joy nor pleasure can she see 
for e'en and morn she cries alas 
and aye the saut tear blink's her ee 
drumossie moor--drumossie day--
a waefu' day it was to me 
for there i lost my father dear 
my father dear and brethren three 

their winding-sheet the bluidy clay 
their graves are growing green to see 
and by them lies the dearest lad
that ever blest a woman's ee 
now wae to thee thou cruel lord 
a bluidy man i trow thou be 
for mony a heart thou hast made sair
that ne'er did wrong to thine or thee 








i've heard them lilting at our ewe-milking 
lasses a' lilting before dawn o' day 
but now they are moaning on ilka green loaning--
the flowers of the forest are a' wede away 

at bughts in the morning nae blythe lads are scorning 
lasses are lonely and dowie and wae 
nae daffin' nae gabbin' but sighing and sabbing 
ilk ane lifts her leglin and hies her away 

in har'st at the shearing nae youths now are jeering 
bandsters are lyart and runkled and gray 
at fair or at preaching nae wooing nae fleeching--
the flowers of the forest are a' wede away 

at e'en in the gloaming nae younkers are roaming
'bout stacks wi' the lasses at bogle to play 
but ilk ane sits drearie lamenting her dearie--
the flowers of the forest are weded away 

dool and wae for the order sent out lads to the border 
the english for ance by guile wan the day 
the flowers of the forest that fought aye the foremost 
the prime of our land are cauld in the clay 

we'll hear nae mair lilting at the ewe-milking 
women and bairns are heartless and wae 
sighing and moaning on ilka green loaning--
the flowers of the forest are a' wede away 








thy braes were bonny yarrow stream 
when first on them i met my lover 
thy braes how dreary yarrow stream 
when now thy waves his body cover 
for ever now o yarrow stream 
thou art to me a stream of sorrow 
for never on thy banks shall i
behold my love the flower of yarrow 

he promised me a milk-white steed
to bear me to his father's bowers 
he promised me a little page
to squire me to his father's towers 
he promised me a wedding-ring --
the wedding-day was fix'd to-morrow --
now he is wedded to his grave 
alas his watery grave in yarrow 

sweet were his words when last we met 
my passion i as freely told him 
clasp'd in his arms i little thought
that i should never more behold him 
scarce was he gone i saw his ghost 
it vanish'd with a shriek of sorrow 
thrice did the water-wraith ascend 
and gave a doleful groan thro' yarrow 

his mother from the window look'd
with all the longing of a mother 
his little sister weeping walk'd
the green-wood path to meet her brother 
they sought him east they sought him west 
they sought him all the forest thorough 
they only saw the cloud of night 
they only heard the roar of yarrow 

no longer from thy window look--
thou hast no son thou tender mother 
no longer walk thou lovely maid 
alas thou hast no more a brother 
no longer seek him east or west
and search no more the forest thorough 
for wandering in the night so dark 
he fell a lifeless corpse in yarrow 

the tear shall never leave my cheek 
no other youth shall be my marrow--
i'll seek thy body in the stream 
and then with thee i'll sleep in yarrow 
--the tear did never leave her cheek 
no other youth became her marrow 
she found his body in the stream 
and now with him she sleeps in yarrow 








down in yon garden sweet and gay
where bonnie grows the lily 
i heard a fair maid sighing say
 my wish be wi' sweet willie 

 willie's rare and willie's fair 
and willie's wondrous bonny 
and willie hecht to marry me
gin e'er he married ony 

 o gentle wind that bloweth south 
from where my love repaireth 
convey a kiss frae his dear mouth
and tell me how he fareth 

 o tell sweet willie to come doon
and hear the mavis singing 
and see the birds on ilka bush
and leaves around them hinging 

 the lav'rock there wi' her white breast
and gentle throat sae narrow 
there's sport eneuch for gentlemen
on leader haughs and yarrow 

 o leader haughs are wide and braid
and yarrow haughs are bonny 
there willie hecht to marry me
if e'er he married ony 

 but willie's gone whom i thought on 
and does not hear me weeping 
draws many a tear frae true love's e'e
when other maids are sleeping 

 yestreen i made my bed fu' braid 
the night i'll mak' it narrow 
for a' the live-lang winter night
i lie twined o' my marrow 

 o came ye by yon water-side 
pou'd you the rose or lily 
or came you by yon meadow green 
or saw you my sweet willie 

she sought him up she sought him down 
she sought him braid and narrow 
syne in the cleaving of a craig 
she found him drown'd in yarrow 








toll for the brave 
the brave that are no more 
all sunk beneath the wave
fast by their native shore 

eight hundred of the brave
whose courage well was tried 
had made the vessel heel
and laid her on her side 

a land-breeze shook the shrouds
and she was overset 
down went the royal george 
with all her crew complete 

toll for the brave 
brave kempenfelt is gone 
his last sea-fight is fought 
his work of glory done 

it was not in the battle 
no tempest gave the shock 
she sprang no fatal leak 
she ran upon no rock 

his sword was in its sheath 
his fingers held the pen 
when kempenfeld went down
with twice four hundred men 

weigh the vessel up
once dreaded by our foes 
and mingle with our cup
the tear that england owes 

her timbers yet are sound 
and she may float again
full charged with england's thunder 
and plough the distant main 

but kempenfeld is gone 
his victories are o'er 
and he and his eight hundred
shall plough the wave no more 








all in the downs the fleet was moor'd 
the streamers waving in the wind 
when black-eyed susan came aboard 
 o where shall i my true-love find 
tell me ye jovial sailors tell me true
if my sweet william sails among the crew 

william who high upon the yard
rock'd with the billow to and fro 
soon as her well-known voice he heard
he sigh'd and cast his eyes below 
the cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands 
and quick as lightning on the deck he stands 

so the sweet lark high poised in air 
shuts close his pinions to his breast
if chance his mate's shrill call he hear 
and drops at once into her nest --
the noblest captain in the british fleet
might envy william's lip those kisses sweet

 o susan susan lovely dear 
my vows shall ever true remain
let me kiss off that falling tear 
we only part to meet again 
change as ye list ye winds my heart shall be
the faithful compass that still points to thee 

 believe not what the landmen say
who tempt with doubts thy constant mind 
they'll tell thee sailors when away 
in every port a mistress find 
yes yes believe them when they tell thee so 
for thou art present wheresoe'er i go 

 if to fair india's coast we sail 
thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright 
thy breath is afric's spicy gale 
thy skin is ivory so white 
thus every beauteous object that i view
wakes in my soul some charm of lovely sue 

 though battle call me from thy arms
let not my pretty susan mourn 
though cannons roar yet safe from harms
william shall to his dear return 
love turns aside the balls that round me fly 
lest precious tears should drop from susan's eye 

the boatswain gave the dreadful word 
the sails their swelling bosom spread 
no longer must she stay aboard 
they kiss'd she sigh'd he hung his head 
her lessening boat unwilling rows to land 
 adieu she cries and waved her lily hand 








of all the girls that are so smart
there's none like pretty sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 
there is no lady in the land
is half so sweet as sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 

her father he makes cabbage-nets 
and through the streets does cry 'em 
her mother she sells laces long
to such as please to buy 'em 
but sure such folks could ne'er beget
so sweet a girl as sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 

when she is by i leave my work 
i love her so sincerely 
my master comes like any turk 
and bangs me most severely--
but let him bang his bellyful 
i'll bear it all for sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 

of all the days that's in the week
i dearly love but one day--
and that's the day that comes betwixt
a saturday and monday 
for then i'm drest all in my best
to walk abroad with sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 

my master carries me to church 
and often am i blamed
because i leave him in the lurch
as soon as text is named 
i leave the church in sermon-time
and slink away to sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 

when christmas comes about again 
o then i shall have money 
i'll hoard it up and box it all 
i'll give it to my honey 
i would it were ten thousand pound 
i'd give it all to sally 
she is the darling of my heart 
and she lives in our alley 

my master and the neighbours all
make game of me and sally 
and but for her i'd better be
a slave and row a galley 
but when my seven long years are out
o then i'll marry sally --
o then we'll wed and then we'll bed 
but not in our alley 








go fetch to me a pint o' wine 
and fill it in a silver tassie 
that i may drink before i go
a service to my bonnie lassie 
the boat rocks at the pier of leith 
fu' loud the wind blaws frae the ferry 
the ship rides by the berwick-law 
and i maun leave my bonnie mary 

the trumpets sound the banners fly 
the glittering spears are rank d ready 
the shouts o' war are heard afar 
the battle closes thick and bloody 
but it's not the roar o' sea or shore
wad make me langer wish to tarry 
nor shouts o' war that's heard afar--
it's leaving thee my bonnie mary 








if doughty deeds my lady please
right soon i'll mount my steed 
and strong his arm and fast his seat
that bears frae me the meed 
i'll wear thy colours in my cap
thy picture in my heart 
and he that bends not to thine eye
shall rue it to his smart 
then tell me how to woo thee love 
o tell me how to woo thee 
for thy dear sake nae care i'll take
tho' ne'er another trow me 

if gay attire delight thine eye
i'll dight me in array 
i'll tend thy chamber door all night 
and squire thee all the day 
if sweetest sounds can win thine ear 
these sounds i'll strive to catch 
thy voice i'll steal to woo thysell 
that voice that nane can match 

but if fond love thy heart can gain 
i never broke a vow 
nae maiden lays her skaith to me 
i never loved but you 
for you alone i ride the ring 
for you i wear the blue 
for you alone i strive to sing 
o tell me how to woo 
then tell me how to woo thee love 
o tell me how to woo thee 
for thy dear sake nae care i'll take 
tho' ne'er another trow me 








sweet stream that winds through yonder glade 
apt emblem of a virtuous maid--
silent and chaste she steals along 
far from the world's gay busy throng 
with gentle yet prevailing force 
intent upon her destined course 
graceful and useful all she does 
blessing and blest where'er she goes 
pure-bosom'd as that watery glass 
and heaven reflected in her face 








sleep on and dream of heaven awhile--
tho' shut so close thy laughing eyes 
thy rosy lips still wear a smile
and move and breathe delicious sighs 

ah now soft blushes tinge her cheeks
and mantle o'er her neck of snow 
ah now she murmurs now she speaks
what most i wish--and fear to know 

she starts she trembles and she weeps 
her fair hands folded on her breast 
--and now how like a saint she sleeps 
a seraph in the realms of rest 

sleep on secure above controul
thy thoughts belong to heaven and thee 
and may the secret of thy soul
remain within its sanctuary 








for ever fortune wilt thou prove
an unrelenting foe to love 
and when we meet a mutual heart
come in between and bid us part 

bid us sigh on from day to day 
and wish and wish the soul away 
till youth and genial years are flown 
and all the life of life is gone 

but busy busy still art thou 
to bind the loveless joyless vow 
the heart from pleasure to delude 
to join the gentle to the rude 

for once o fortune hear my prayer 
and i absolve thy future care 
all other blessings i resign 
make but the dear amanda mine 








the merchant to secure his treasure 
conveys it in a borrow'd name 
euphelia serves to grace my measure 
but cloe is my real flame 

my softest verse my darling lyre
upon euphelia's toilet lay--
when cloe noted her desire
that i should sing that i should play 

my lyre i tune my voice i raise 
but with my numbers mix my sighs 
and whilst i sing euphelia's praise 
i fix my soul on cloe's eyes 

fair cloe blush'd euphelia frown'd 
i sung and gazed i play'd and trembled 
and venus to the loves around
remark'd how ill we all dissembled 








when lovely woman stoops to folly
and finds too late that men betray --
what charm can soothe her melancholy 
what art can wash her guilt away 

the only art her guilt to cover 
to hide her shame from every eye 
to give repentance to her lover
and wring his bosom is--to die 








ye banks and braes o' bonnie doon
how can ye blume sae fair 
how can ye chant ye little birds 
and i sae fu' o' care 

thou'll break my heart thou bonnie bird
that sings upon the bough 
thou minds me o' the happy days
when my fause luve was true 

thou'll break my heart thou bonnie bird
that sings beside thy mate 
for sae i sat and sae i sang 
and wist na o' my fate 

aft hae i roved by bonnie doon
to see the woodbine twine 
and ilka bird sang o' its love 
and sae did i o' mine 

wi' lightsome heart i pu'd a rose 
frae aff its thorny tree 
and my fause luver staw the rose 
but left the thorn wi' me 








 a pindaric ode 

awake aeolian lyre awake 
and give to rapture all thy trembling strings 
from helicon's harmonious springs
a thousand rills their mazy progress take 
the laughing flowers that round them blow
drink life and fragrance as they flow 
now the rich stream of music winds along
deep majestic smooth and strong 
through verdant vales and ceres' golden reign 
now rolling down the steep amain
headlong impetuous see it pour 
the rocks and nodding groves re-bellow to the roar 

o sovereign of the willing soul 
parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs 
enchanting shell the sullen cares
and frantic passions hear thy soft control 
on thracia's hills the lord of war
has curb'd the fury of his car
and dropt his thirsty lance at thy command 
perching on the sceptred hand
of jove thy magic lulls the feather'd king
with ruffled plumes and flagging wing 
quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie
the terror of his beak and lightnings of his eye 

thee the voice the dance obey 
temper'd to thy warbled lay 
o'er idalia's velvet-green
the rosy-crown d loves are seen
on cytherea's day 
with antic sport and blue-eyed pleasures 
frisking light in frolic measures 
now pursuing now retreating 
now in circling troops they meet 
to brisk notes in cadence beating
glance their many-twinkling feet 
slow-melting strains their queen's approach declare 
where'er she turns the graces homage pay 
with arms sublime that float upon the air
in gliding state she wins her easy way 
o'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move
the bloom of young desire and purple light of love 

man's feeble race what ills await 
labour and penury the racks of pain 
disease and sorrow's weeping train 
and death sad refuge from the storms of fate 
the fond complaint my song disprove 
and justify the laws of jove 
say has he given in vain the heavenly muse 
night and all her sickly dews 
her spectres wan and birds of boding cry
he gives to range the dreary sky 
till down the eastern cliffs afar
hyperion's march they spy and glittering shafts of war 

in climes beyond the solar road
where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam 
the muse has broke the twilight gloom
to cheer the shivering native's dull abode 
and oft beneath the odorous shade
of chili's boundless forests laid 
she deigns to hear the savage youth repeat
in loose numbers wildly sweet
their feather-cinctured chiefs and dusky loves 
her track where'er the goddess roves 
glory pursue and generous shame 
th' unconquerable mind and freedom's holy flame 

woods that wave o'er delphi's steep 
isles that crown th' aegean deep 
fields that cool ilissus laves
or where maeander's amber waves
in lingering lab'rinths creep 
how do your tuneful echoes languish 
mute but to the voice of anguish 
where each old poetic mountain
inspiration breathed around 
every shade and hallow'd fountain
murmur'd deep a solemn sound 
till the sad nine in greece's evil hour
left their parnassus for the latian plains 
alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant power 
and coward vice that revels in her chains 
when latium had her lofty spirit lost 
they sought o albion next thy sea-encircled coast 

far from the sun and summer-gale
in thy green lap was nature's darling laid 
what time where lucid avon stray'd 
to him the mighty mother did unveil
her awful face the dauntless child
stretch'd forth his little arms and smiled 
this pencil take she said whose colours clear
richly paint the vernal year 
thine too these golden keys immortal boy 
this can unlock the gates of joy 
of horror that and thrilling fears 
or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears 

nor second he that rode sublime
upon the seraph-wings of ecstasy
the secrets of the abyss to spy 
he pass'd the flaming bounds of place and time 
the living throne the sapphire-blaze
where angels tremble while they gaze 
he saw but blasted with excess of light 
closed his eyes in endless night 
behold where dryden's less presumptuous car
wide o'er the fields of glory bear
two coursers of ethereal race
with necks in thunder clothed and long-resounding pace 

hark his hands the lyre explore 
bright-eyed fancy hovering o'er 
scatters from her pictured urn
thoughts that breathe and words that burn 
but ah 'tis heard no more--
o lyre divine what daring spirit
wakes thee now tho' he inherit
nor the pride nor ample pinion
that the theban eagle bear 
sailing with supreme dominion
thro' the azure deep of air 
yet oft before his infant eyes would run
such forms as glitter in the muse's ray
with orient hues unborrow'd of the sun 
yet shall he mount and keep his distant way
beyond the limits of a vulgar fate 
beneath the good how far--but far above the great 








 an ode for music 

when music heavenly maid was young 
while yet in early greece she sung 
the passions oft to hear her shell 
throng'd around her magic cell
exulting trembling raging fainting 
possest beyond the muse's painting 
by turns they felt the glowing mind
disturb'd delighted raised refined 
'till once 'tis said when all were fired 
fill'd with fury rapt inspired 
from the supporting myrtles round
they snatch'd her instruments of sound 
and as they oft had heard apart
sweet lessons of her forceful art 
each for madness ruled the hour 
would prove his own expressive power 

first fear his hand its skill to try 
amid the chords bewilder'd laid 
and back recoil'd he knew not why 
e'en at the sound himself had made 

next anger rush'd his eyes on fire 
in lightnings own'd his secret stings 
in one rude clash he struck the lyre
and swept with hurried hand the strings 

with woeful measures wan despair--
low sullen sounds his grief beguiled 
a solemn strange and mingled air 
'twas sad by fits by starts 'twas wild 

but thou o hope with eyes so fair 
what was thy delighted measure 
still it whisper'd promised pleasure
and bade the lovely scenes at distance hail 
still would her touch the strain prolong 
and from the rocks the woods the vale
she call'd on echo still through all the song 
and where her sweetest theme she chose 
a soft responsive voice was heard at every close 
and hope enchanted smiled and waved her golden hair --
and longer had she sung --but with a frown revenge impatient rose 
he threw his blood-stain'd sword in thunder down 
and with a withering look
the war-denouncing trumpet took
and blew a blast so loud and dread 
were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe 
and ever and anon he beat
the doubling drum with furious heat 
and though sometimes each each dreary pause between 
dejected pity at his side
her soul-subduing voice applied 
yet still he kept his wild unalter'd mien 
while each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head 

thy numbers jealousy to nought were fix'd 
sad proof of thy distressful state 
of differing themes the veering song was mix'd 
and now it courted love now raving call'd on hate 

with eyes up-raised as one inspired 
pale melancholy sat retired 
and from her wild sequester'd seat 
in notes by distance made more sweet 
pour'd through the mellow horn her pensive soul 
and dashing soft from rocks around
bubbling runnels join'd the sound 
through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole 
or o'er some haunted stream with fond delay 
round an holy calm diffusing 
love of peace and lonely musing 
in hollow murmurs died away 

but o how alter'd was its sprightlier tone
when cheerfulness a nymph of healthiest hue 
her bow across her shoulder flung 
her buskins gemm'd with morning dew 
blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung 
the hunter's call to faun and dryad known 
the oak-crown'd sisters and their chaste-eyed queen 
satyrs and sylvan boys were seen
peeping from forth their alleys green 
brown exercise rejoiced to hear 
and sport leap'd up and seized his beechen spear 

last came joy's ecstatic trial 
he with viny crown advancing 
first to the lively pipe his hand addrest 
but soon he saw the brisk awakening viol
whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best 
they would have thought who heard the strain
they saw in tempe's vale her native maids
amidst the festal-sounding shades
to some unwearied minstrel dancing 
while as his flying fingers kiss'd the stings 
love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round 
loose were her tresses seen her zone unbound 
and he amidst his frolic play 
as if he would the charming air repay 
shook thousand odours from his dewy wings 

o music sphere-descended maid 
friend of pleasure wisdom's aid 
why goddess why to us denied 
lay'st thou thy ancient lyre aside 
as in that loved athenian bower
you learn'd an all-commanding power 
thy mimic soul o nymph endear'd 
can well recall what then it heard 
where is thy native simple heart
devote to virtue fancy art 
arise as in that elder time 
warm energetic chaste sublime 
thy wonders in that god-like age 
fill thy recording sister's page --
'tis said and i believe the tale 
thy humblest reed could more prevail
had more of strength diviner rage 
than all which charms this laggard age 
e'en all at once together found
cecilia's mingled world of sound --
o bid our vain endeavours cease 
revive the just designs of greece 
return in all thy simple state 
confirm the tales her sons relate 








lo where the rosy-bosom'd hours 
fair venus' train appear 
disclose the long-expecting flowers
and wake the purple year 
the attic warbler pours her throat
responsive to the cuckoo's note 
the untaught harmony of spring 
while whispering pleasure as they fly 
cool zephyrs through the clear blue sky
their gather'd fragrance fling 

where'er the oak's thick branches stretch
a broader browner shade 
where'er the rude and moss-grown beech
o'er-canopies the glade 
beside some water's rushy brink
with me the muse shall sit and think
 at ease reclined in rustic state 
how vain the ardour of the crowd 
how low how little are the proud 
how indigent the great 

still is the toiling hand of care 
the panting herds repose 
yet hark how thro' the peopled air
the busy murmur glows 
the insect youth are on the wing 
eager to taste the honied spring
and float amid the liquid noon 
some lightly o'er the current skim 
some show their gaily-gilded trim
quick-glancing to the sun 

to contemplation's sober eye
such is the race of man 
and they that creep and they that fly 
shall end where they began 
alike the busy and the gay
but flutter thro' life's little day 
in fortune's varying colours drest 
brush'd by the hand of rough mischance 
or chill'd by age their airy dance
they leave in dust to rest 

methinks i hear in accents low 
the sportive kind reply 
poor moralist and what art thou 
a solitary fly 
thy joys no glittering female meets 
no hive hast thou of hoarded sweets 
no painted plumage to display 
on hasty wings thy youth is flown 
thy sun is set thy spring is gone--
we frolic while 'tis may 








the poplars are fell'd farewell to the shade
and the whispering sound of the cool colonnade 
the winds play no longer and sing in the leaves 
nor ouse on his bosom their image receives 

twelve years have elapsed since i last took a view
of my favourite field and the bank where they grew 
and now in the grass behold they are laid 
and the tree is my seat that once lent me a shade 

the blackbird has fled to another retreat
where the hazels afford him a screen from the heat 
and the scene where his melody charm'd me before
resounds with his sweet-flowing ditty no more 

my fugitive years are all hasting away 
and i must ere long lie lowly as they 
with a turf on my breast and a stone at my head 
ere another such grove shall arise in its stead 

'tis a sight to engage me if anything can 
to muse on the perishing pleasures of man 
short-lived as we are our enjoyments i see 
have a still shorter date and die sooner than we 








wee sleekit cow'rin' tim'rous beastie 
o what a panic's in thy breastie 
thou need na start awa sae hasty 
wi' bickering brattle 
i wad be laith to rin and chase thee
wi' murd'ring pattle 

i'm truly sorry man's dominion 
has broken nature's social union 
an' justifies that ill opinion
which makes thee startle
at me thy poor earth-born companion 
an' fellow-mortal 

i doubt na whiles but thou may thieve 
what then poor beastie thou maun live 
a daimen icker in a thrave
's a sma' request 
i'll get a blessin wi' the lave 
an' never miss't 

thy wee bit housie too in ruin 
it's silly wa's the win's are strewin 
an' naething now to big a new ane 
o' foggage green 
and bleak december's winds ensuin'
baith snell and keen 

thou saw the fields laid bare an' waste 
and weary winter comin' fast 
and cozie here beneath the blast 
thou thought to dwell 
till crash the cruel coulter past
out thro' thy cell 

that wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble 
has cost thee mony a weary nibble 
now thou's turn'd out for a' thy trouble 
but house or hald 
to thole the winter's sleety dribble 
an' cranreuch cauld 

but mousie thou art no thy lane 
in proving foresight may be vain 
the best laid schemes o' mice and men
gang aft a-gley 
and lea'e us nought but grief and pain 
for promised joy 

still thou art blest compared wi' me 
the present only toucheth thee 
but och i backward cast my e'e 
on prospects drear 
an' forward tho' i canna see 
i guess and fear 








mine be a cot beside the hill 
a bee-hive's hum shall sooth my ear 
a willowy brook that turns a mill 
with many a fall shall linger near 

the swallow oft beneath my thatch
shall twitter from her clay-built nest 
oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch 
and share my meal a welcome guest 

around my ivied porch shall spring
each fragrant flower that drinks the dew 
and lucy at her wheel shall sing
in russet-gown and apron blue 

the village-church among the trees 
where first our marriage-vows were given 
with merry peals shall swell the breeze
and point with taper spire to heaven 








if aught of oaten stop or pastoral song
may hope chaste eve to soothe thy modest ear
like thy own solemn springs 
thy springs and dying gales 

o nymph reserved --while now the bright-hair'd sun
sits in yon western tent whose cloudy skirts
with brede ethereal wove 
o'erhang his wavy bed 

now air is hush'd save where the weak-eyed bat
with short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing 
or where the beetle winds
his small but sullen horn 

as oft he rises midst the twilight path
against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum --
now teach me maid composed 
to breathe some soften'd strain

whose numbers stealing through thy dark'ning vale 
may not unseemly with its stillness suit 
as musing slow i hail
thy genial loved return 

for when thy folding-star arising shows
his paly circlet at his warning lamp
the fragrant hours and elves
who slept in buds the day 

and many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge
and sheds the freshening dew and lovelier still
the pensive pleasures sweet 
prepare thy shadowy car 

then let me rove some wild and heathy scene 
or find some ruin midst its dreary dells 
whose walls more awful nod
by thy religious gleams 

or if chill blustering winds or driving rain
prevent my willing feet be mine the hut
that from the mountain's side
views wilds and swelling floods 

and hamlets brown and dim-discover'd spires 
and hears their simple bell and marks o'er all
thy dewy fingers draw
the gradual dusky veil 

while spring shall pour his showers as oft he wont 
and bathe thy breathing tresses meekest eve 
while summer loves to sport
beneath thy lingering light 

while sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves 
or winter yelling through the troublous air 
affrights thy shrinking train 
and rudely rends thy robes 

so long regardful of thy quiet rule 
shall fancy friendship science smiling peace 
thy gentlest influence own 
and love thy favourite name 








the curfew tolls the knell of parting day 
the lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea 
the ploughman homeward plods his weary way 
and leaves the world to darkness and to me 

now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight 
and all the air a solemn stillness holds 
save where the beetle wheels his droning flight 
and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds 

save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower
the moping owl does to the moon complain
of such as wandering near her secret bower 
molest her ancient solitary reign 

beneath those rugged elms that yew-tree's shade 
where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap 
each in his narrow cell for ever laid 
the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep 

the breezy call of incense-breathing morn 
the swallow twittering from the straw-built shed 
the cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn 
no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed 

for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn
or busy housewife ply her evening care 
no children run to lisp their sire's return 
or climb his knees the envied kiss to share 

oft did the harvest to their sickle yield 
their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke 
how jocund did they drive their team afield 
how bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke 

let not ambition mock their useful toil 
their homely joys and destiny obscure 
nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
the short and simple annals of the poor 

the boast of heraldry the pomp of power 
and all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave 
await alike th' inevitable hour --
the paths of glory lead but to the grave 

nor you ye proud impute to these the fault
if memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise 
where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault 
the pealing anthem swells the note of praise 

can storied urn or animated bust
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath 
can honour's voice provoke the silent dust 
or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death 

perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
some heart once pregnant with celestial fire 
hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd 
or waked to ecstasy the living lyre 

but knowledge to their eyes her ample page
rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll 
chill penury repress'd their noble rage 
and froze the genial current of the soul 

full many a gem of purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear 
full many a flower is born to blush unseen 
and waste its sweetness on the desert air 

some village-hampden that with dauntless breast
the little tyrant of his fields withstood 
some mute inglorious milton here may rest 
some cromwell guiltless of his country's blood 

th' applause of listening senates to command 
the threats of pain and ruin to despise 
to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land 
and read their history in a nation's eyes

their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone
their growing virtues but their crimes confined 
forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne 
and shut the gates of mercy on mankind 

the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide 
to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame 
or heap the shrine of luxury and pride
with incense kindled at the muse's flame 

far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife
their sober wishes never learn'd to stray 
along the cool sequester'd vale of life
they kept the noiseless tenour of their way 

yet e'en these bones from insult to protect
some frail memorial still erected nigh 
with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd 
implores the passing tribute of a sigh 

their name their years spelt by the unletter'd muse 
the place of fame and elegy supply 
and many a holy text around she strews 
that teach the rustic moralist to die 

for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey 
this pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd 
left the warm precincts of the cheerful day 
nor cast one longing lingering look behind 

on some fond breast the parting soul relies 
some pious drops the closing eye requires 
e'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries 
e'en in our ashes live their wonted fires 

for thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead 
dost in those lines their artless tale relate 
if chance by lonely contemplation led 
some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate --

haply some hoary-headed swain may say 
oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn 
brushing with hasty steps the dews away 
to meet the sun upon the upland lawn 

there at the foot of yonder nodding beech
that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high 
his listless length at noon-tide would he stretch 
and pore upon the brook that babbles by 

hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn 
muttering his wayward fancies he would rove 
now drooping woeful-wan like one forlorn 
or crazed with care or cross'd in hopeless love 

one morn i miss'd him on the custom'd hill 
along the heath and near his favourite tree 
another came nor yet beside the rill 
nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he 

the next with dirges due in sad array 
slow through the church-way path we saw him borne --
approach and read for thou canst read the lay
graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn 



here rests his head upon the lap of earth
a youth to fortune and to fame unknown 
fair science frown'd not on his humble birth 
and melancholy mark'd him for her own 

large was his bounty and his soul sincere 
heaven did a recompense as largely send 
he gave to misery all he had a tear 
he gain'd from heaven 'twas all he wish'd a friend 

no farther seek his merits to disclose 
or draw his frailties from their dread abode 
 there they alike in trembling hope repose 
the bosom of his father and his god 








o mary at thy window be 
it is the wish'd the trysted hour 
those smiles and glances let me see
that make the miser's treasure poor 
how blythely wad i bide the stoure 
a weary slave frae sun to sun 
could i the rich reward secure 
the lovely mary morison 

yestreen when to the trembling string
the dance gaed thro' the lighted ha' 
to thee my fancy took its wing --
i sat but neither heard nor saw 
tho' this was fair and that was braw 
and yon the toast of a' the town 
i sigh'd and said amang them a' 
 ye are na mary morison 

o mary canst thou wreck his peace
wha for thy sake wad gladly dee 
or canst thou break that heart of his 
whase only faut is loving thee 
if love for love thou wilt na gie 
at least be pity to me shown 
a thought ungentle canna be
the thought o' mary morison 








o saw ye bonnie lesley
as she gaed o'er the border 
she's gane like alexander 
to spread her conquests farther 

to see her is to love her 
and love but her for ever 
for nature made her what she is 
and ne'er made sic anither 

thou art a queen fair lesley 
thy subjects we before thee 
thou art divine fair lesley 
the hearts o' men adore thee 

the deil he could na scaith thee 
or aught that wad belang thee 
he'd look into thy bonnie face 
and say i canna wrang thee 

the powers aboon will tent thee 
misfortune sha' na steer thee 
thou'rt like themselves sae lovely
that ill they'll ne'er let near thee 

return again fair lesley 
return to caledonie 
that we may brag we hae a lass
there's nane again sae bonnie 








o my luve's like a red red rose
that's newly sprung in june 
o my luve's like the melodie
that's sweetly play'd in tune 

as fair art thou my bonnie lass 
so deep in luve am i 
and i will luve thee still my dear 
till a' the seas gang dry 

till a' the seas gang dry my dear 
and the rocks melt wi' the sun 
i will luve thee still my dear 
while the sands o' life shall run 

and fare thee weel my only luve 
and fare thee weel a while 
and i will come again my luve
tho' it were ten thousand mile 








ye banks and braes and streams around
the castle o' montgomery 
green be your woods and fair your flowers 
your waters never drumlie 
there simmer first unfauld her robes 
and there the langest tarry 
for there i took the last fareweel
o' my sweet highland mary 

how sweetly bloom'd the gay green birk 
how rich the hawthorn's blossom 
as underneath their fragrant shade
i clasp'd her to my bosom 
the golden hours on angel wings
flew o'er me and my dearie 
for dear to me as light and life
was my sweet highland mary 

wi' mony a vow and lock'd embrace
our parting was fu' tender 
and pledging aft to meet again 
we tore oursels asunder 
but o fell death's untimely frost 
that nipt my flower sae early 
now green's the sod and cauld's the clay 
that wraps my highland mary 

o pale pale now those rosy lips 
i aft hae kiss'd sae fondly 
and closed for aye the sparkling glance
that dwelt on me sae kindly 
and mouldering now in silent dust
that heart that lo'ed me dearly 
but still within my bosom's core
shall live my highland mary 








when the sheep are in the fauld and the kye at hame 
and a' the warld to rest are gane 
the waes o' my heart fa' in showers frae my e'e 
while my gudeman lies sound by me 

young jamie lo'ed me weel and sought me for his bride 
but saving a croun he had naething else beside 
to make the croun a pund young jamie gaed to sea 
and the croun and the pund were baith for me 

he hadna been awa' a week but only twa 
when my father brak his arm and the cow was stown awa 
my mother she fell sick and my jamie at the sea--
and auld robin gray came a-courtin' me 

my father couldna work and my mother couldna spin 
i toil'd day and night but their bread i couldna win 
auld rob maintain'd them baith and wi' tears in his e'e
said jennie for their sakes o marry me 

my heart it said nay i look'd for jamie back 
but the wind it blew high and the ship it was a wrack 
his ship it was a wrack--why didna jamie dee 
or why do i live to cry wae's me 

my father urgit sair my mother didna speak 
but she look'd in my face till my heart was like to break 
they gi'ed him my hand but my heart was at the sea 
sae auld robin gray he was gudeman to me 

i hadna been a wife a week but only four 
when mournfu' as i sat on the stane at the door 
i saw my jamie's wraith for i couldna think it he--
till he said i'm come hame to marry thee 

o sair sair did we greet and muckle did we say 
we took but ae kiss and i bad him gang away 
i wish that i were dead but i'm no like to dee 
and why was i born to say wae's me 

i gang like a ghaist and i carena to spin 
i daurna think on jamie for that wad be a sin 
but i'll do my best a gude wife aye to be 
for auld robin gray he is kind unto me

and are ye sure the news is true 
and are ye sure he's weel 
is this a time to think o' wark

is this the time to spin a thread 
when colin's at the door 
reach down my cloak i'll to the quay

for there's nae luck about the house

of a' the airts the wind can blaw
i dearly like the west 
for there the bonnie lassie lives 
the lassie i lo'e best 
there wild woods grow and rivers row 
and mony a hill between 
but day and night my fancy's flight
is ever wi' my jean 

i see her in the dewy flowers 
i see her sweet and fair 
i hear her in the tunefu' birds 
i hear her charm the air 
there's not a bonnie flower that springs 
by fountain shaw or green 
there's not a bonnie bird that sings
but minds me o' my jean 

o blaw ye westlin winds blaw saft
amang the leafy trees 
wi' balmy gale frae hill and dale
bring hame the laden bees 
and bring the lassie back to me
that's aye sae neat and clean 
ae smile o' her wad banish care 
sae charming is my jean 

what sighs and vows amang the knowes
hae pass'd atween us twa 
how fond to meet how wae to part
that night she gaed awa 
the powers aboon can only ken
to whom the heart is seen 
that nane can be sae dear to me
as my sweet lovely jean

ye distant spires ye antique towers
that crown the wat'ry glade 
where grateful science still adores
her henry's holy shade 
and ye that from the stately brow
of windsor's heights th' expanse below
of grove of lawn of mead survey 
whose turf whose shade whose flowers among
wanders the hoary thames along
his silver-winding way 

ah happy hills ah pleasing shade 
ah fields beloved in vain 
where once my careless childhood stray'd 
a stranger yet to pain 
i feel the gales that from ye blow
a momentary bliss bestow 
as waving fresh their gladsome wing 
my weary soul they seem to soothe 
and redolent of joy and youth 
to breathe a second spring 

say father thames for thou hast seen
full many a sprightly race
disporting on thy margent green
the paths of pleasure trace 
who foremost now delight to cleave
with pliant arm thy glassy wave 
the captive linnet which enthral 
what idle progeny succeed
to chase the rolling circle's speed
or urge the flying ball 

while some on earnest business bent
their murmuring labours ply
'gainst graver hours that bring constraint
to sweeten liberty 
some bold adventurers disdain
the limits of their little reign
and unknown regions dare descry 
still as they run they look behind 
they hear a voice in every wind
and snatch a fearful joy 

gay hope is theirs by fancy fed 
less pleasing when possest 
the tear forgot as soon as shed 
the sunshine of the breast 
theirs buxom health of rosy hue 
wild wit invention ever new 
and lively cheer of vigour born 
the thoughtless day the easy night 
the spirits pure the slumbers light
that fly th' approach of morn 

alas regardless of their doom
the little victims play 
no sense have they of ills to come
nor care beyond to-day 
yet see how all around 'em wait
the ministers of human fate
and black misfortune's baleful train 
ah shew them where in ambush stand
to seize their prey the murderous band 
ah tell them they are men 

these shall the fury passions tear 
the vultures of the mind 
disdainful anger pallid fear 
and shame that skulks behind 
or pining love shall waste their youth 
or jealousy with rankling tooth
that inly gnaws the secret heart 
and envy wan and faded care 
grim-visaged comfortless despair 
and sorrow's piercing dart 

ambition this shall tempt to rise 
then whirl the wretch from high
to bitter scorn a sacrifice
and grinning infamy 
the stings of falsehood those shall try 
and hard unkindness' alter'd eye 
that mocks the tear it forced to flow 
and keen remorse with blood defiled 
and moody madness laughing wild
amid severest woe 

lo in the vale of years beneath
a griesly troop are seen 
the painful family of death 
more hideous than their queen 
this racks the joints this fires the veins 
that every labouring sinew strains 
those in the deeper vitals rage 
lo poverty to fill the band 
that numbs the soul with icy hand 
and slow-consuming age 

to each his sufferings all are men 
condemn'd alike to groan 
the tender for another's pain 
th' unfeeling for his own 
yet ah why should they know their fate 
since sorrow never comes too late 
and happiness too swiftly flies 
thought would destroy their paradise 
no more --where ignorance is bliss 
'tis folly to be wise 








daughter of jove relentless power 
thou tamer of the human breast 
whose iron scourge and torturing hour
the bad affright afflict the best 
bound in thy adamantine chain
the proud are taught to taste of pain 
and purple tyrants vainly groan
with pangs unfelt before unpitied and alone 

when first thy sire to send on earth
virtue his darling child design'd 
to thee he gave the heavenly birth
and bade to form her infant mind 
stern rugged nurse thy rigid lore
with patience many a year she bore 
what sorrow was thou bad'st her know 
and from her own she learn'd to melt at others' woe 

scared at thy frown terrific fly
self-pleasing folly's idle brood 
wild laughter noise and thoughtless joy 
and leave us leisure to be good 
light they disperse and with them go
the summer friend the flattering foe 
by vain prosperity received
to her they vow their truth and are again believed 

and melancholy silent maid 
with leaden eye that loves the ground 
still on thy solemn steps attend 
warm charity the general friend 
with justice to herself severe 
and pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear 

oh gently on thy suppliant's head 
dread goddess lay thy chastening hand 
not in thy gorgon terrors clad 
not circled with the vengeful band
 as by the impious thou art seen 
with thundering voice and threatening mien 
with screaming horror's funeral cry 
despair and fell disease and ghastly poverty 

thy form benign o goddess wear 
thy milder influence impart 
thy philosophic train be there
to soften not to wound my heart 
the generous spark extinct revive 
teach me to love and to forgive 
exact my own defects to scan 
what others are to feel and know myself a man 








i am monarch of all i survey 
my right there is none to dispute 
from the centre all round to the sea
i am lord of the fowl and the brute 
o solitude where are the charms
that sages have seen in thy face 
better dwell in the midst of alarms
than reign in this horrible place 

i am out of humanity's reach 
i must finish my journey alone 
never hear the sweet music of speech 
i start at the sound of my own 
the beasts that roam over the plain
my form with indifference see 
they are so unacquainted with man 
their tameness is shocking to me 

society friendship and love
divinely bestow'd upon man 
o had i the wings of a dove
how soon would i taste you again 
my sorrows i then might assuage
in the ways of religion and truth 
might learn from the wisdom of age 
and be cheer'd by the sallies of youth 

ye winds that have made me your sport 
convey to this desolate shore
some cordial endearing report
of a land i shall visit no more 
my friends do they now and then send
a wish or a thought after me 
o tell me i yet have a friend 
though a friend i am never to see 

how fleet is a glance of the mind 
compared with the speed of its flight 
the tempest itself lags behind 
and the swift-wing d arrows of light 
when i think of my own native land
in a moment i seem to be there 
but alas recollection at hand
soon hurries me back to despair 

but the seafowl is gone to her nest 
the beast is laid down in his lair 
even here is a season of rest 
and i to my cabin repair 
there's mercy in every place 
and mercy encouraging thought 
gives even affliction a grace
and reconciles man to his lot 








mary i want a lyre with other strings 
such aid from heaven as some have feign'd they drew 
an eloquence scarce given to mortals new
and undebased by praise of meaner things 

that ere through age or woe i shed my wings
i may record thy worth with honour due 
in verse as musical as thou art true
and that immortalizes whom it sings --

but thou hast little need there is a book
by seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light 
on which the eyes of god not rarely look 

a chronicle of actions just and bright--
there all thy deeds my faithful mary shine 
and since thou own'st that praise i spare thee mine 








the twentieth year is well nigh past
since first our sky was overcast 
ah would that this might be the last 
my mary 

thy spirits have a fainter flow 
i see thee daily weaker grow--
'twas my distress that brought thee low 
my mary 

thy needles once a shining store 
for my sake restless heretofore 
now rust disused and shine no more 
my mary 

for though thou gladly wouldst fulfil
the same kind office for me still 
thy sight now seconds not thy will 
my mary 

but well thou play'dst the housewife's part 
and all thy threads with magic art
have wound themselves about this heart 
my mary 

thy indistinct expressions seem
like language utter'd in a dream 
yet me they charm whate'er the theme 
my mary 

thy silver locks once auburn bright
are still more lovely in my sight
than golden beams of orient light 
my mary 

for could i view nor them nor thee 
what sight worth seeing could i see 
the sun would rise in vain for me 
my mary 

partakers of thy sad decline
thy hands their little force resign 
yet gently press'd press gently mine 
my mary 

such feebleness of limbs thou prov'st
that now at every step thou mov'st
upheld by two yet still thou lov'st 
my mary 

and still to love though press'd with ill 
in wintry age to feel no chill 
with me is to be lovely still 
my mary 

but ah by constant heed i know
how oft the sadness that i show
transforms thy smiles to looks of woe 
my mary 

and should my future lot be cast
with much resemblance of the past
thy worn-out heart will break at last--
my mary 








why damon with the forward day
dost thou thy little spot survey 
from tree to tree with doubtful cheer 
pursue the progress of the year 
what winds arise what rains descend 
when thou before that year shalt end 

what do thy noontide walks avail 
to clear the leaf and pick the snail 
then wantonly to death decree
an insect usefuller than thee 
thou and the worm are brother-kind 
as low as earthy and as blind 

vain wretch canst thou expect to see
the downy peach make court to thee 
or that thy sense shall ever meet
the bean-flower's deep-embosom'd sweet
exhaling with an evening blast 
thy evenings then will all be past 

thy narrow pride thy fancied green
 for vanity's in little seen 
all must be left when death appears 
in spite of wishes groans and tears 
nor one of all thy plants that grow
but rosemary will with thee go 








in the downhill of life when i find i'm declining 
may my lot no less fortunate be
than a snug elbow-chair can afford for reclining 
and a cot that o'erlooks the wide sea 
with an ambling pad-pony to pace o'er the lawn 
while i carol away idle sorrow 
and blithe as the lark that each day hails the dawn
look forward with hope for to-morrow 

with a porch at my door both for shelter and shade too 
as the sunshine or rain may prevail 
and a small spot of ground for the use of the spade too 
with a barn for the use of the flail 
a cow for my dairy a dog for my game 
and a purse when a friend wants to borrow 
i'll envy no nabob his riches or fame 
nor what honours await him to-morrow 

from the bleak northern blast may my cot be completely
secured by a neighbouring hill 
and at night may repose steal upon me more sweetly
by the sound of a murmuring rill 
and while peace and plenty i find at my board 
with a heart free from sickness and sorrow 
with my friends may i share what to-day may afford 
and let them spread the table to-morrow 

and when i at last must throw off this frail covering
which i've worn for three-score years and ten 
on the brink of the grave i'll not seek to keep hovering 
nor my thread wish to spin o'er again 
but my face in the glass i'll serenely survey 
and with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow 
as this old worn-out stuff which is threadbare to-day
may become everlasting to-morrow 








life i know not what thou art 
but know that thou and i must part 
and when or how or where we met
i own to me's a secret yet 

life we've been long together
through pleasant and through cloudy weather 
'tis hard to part when friends are dear--
perhaps 'twill cost a sigh a tear 
--then steal away give little warning 
choose thine own time 
say not good night --but in some brighter clime
bid me good morning 













it proves sufficiently the lavish wealth of our own age in poetry that
the pieces which without conscious departure from the standard of
excellence render this book by far the longest were with very few
exceptions composed during the first thirty years the nineteenth
century exhaustive reasons can hardly be given for the strangely sudden
appearance of individual genius but none in the editor's judgment can
be less adequate than that which assigns the splendid national
achievements of our recent poetry to an impulse from the frantic
follies and criminal wars that at the time disgraced the least
essentially civilised of our foreign neighbours the first french
revolution was rather in his opinion one result and in itself by no
means the most important of that far wider and greater spirit which
through enquiry and doubt through pain and triumph sweeps mankind
round the circles of its gradual development and it is to this that we
must trace the literature of modern europe but without more detailed
discussion on the motive causes of scott wordsworth campbell keats 
and shelley we may observe that these poets with others carried to
further perfection the later tendencies of the century preceding in
simplicity of narrative reverence for human passion and character in
every sphere and impassioned love of nature --that whilst maintaining
on the whole the advances in art made since the restoration they
renewed the half-forgotten melody and depth of tone which marked the
best elizabethan writers --that lastly to what was thus inherited they
added a richness in language and a variety in metre a force and fire in
narrative a tenderness and bloom in feeling an insight into the finer
passages of the soul and the inner meanings of the landscape a larger
and wiser humanity --hitherto hardly attained and perhaps unattainable
even by predecessors of not inferior individual genius in a word the
nation which after the greeks in their glory has been the most gifted
of all nations for poetry expressed in these men the highest strength
and prodigality of its nature they interpreted the age to itself--hence
the many phases of thought and style they present --to sympathise with
each fervently and impartially without fear and without fancifulness 
is no doubtful step in the higher education of the soul for as with
the affections and the conscience purity in taste is absolutely
proportionate to strength --and when once the mind has raised itself to
grasp and to delight in excellence those who love most will be found to
love most wisely 







much have i travell'd in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen 
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold 

oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep-brow'd homer ruled as his demesne 
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold 

--then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken 
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes

he stared at the pacific--and all his men
look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
silent upon a peak in darien 








bards of passion and of mirth
ye have left your souls on earth 
have ye souls in heaven too 
doubled-lived in regions new 
--yes and those of heaven commune
with the spheres of sun and moon 
with the noise of fountains wonderous
and the parle of voices thunderous 
with the whisper of heaven's trees
and one another in soft ease
seated on elysian lawns
browsed by none but dian's fawns 
underneath large blue-bells tented 
where the daisies are rose-scented 
and the rose herself has got
perfume which on earth is not 
where the nightingale doth sing
not a senseless tranc d thing 
but divine melodious truth 
philosophic numbers smooth 
tales and golden histories
of heaven and its mysteries 

thus ye live on high and then
on the earth ye live again 
and the souls ye left behind you
teach us here the way to find you
where your other souls are joying 
never slumber'd never cloying 
here your earth-born souls still speak
to mortals of their little week 
of their sorrows and delights 
of their passions and their spites 
of their glory and their shame 
what doth strengthen and what maim --
thus ye teach us every day 
wisdom though fled far away 

bards of passion and of mirth
ye have left your souls on earth 
ye have souls in heaven too 
double-lived in regions new 








all thoughts all passions all delights 
whatever stirs this mortal frame 
all are but ministers of love 
and feed his sacred flame 

oft in my waking dreams do i
live o'er again that happy hour 
when midway on the mount i lay
beside the ruin'd tower 

the moonshine stealing o'er the scene
had blended with the lights of eve 
and she was there my hope my joy 
my own dear genevieve 

she lean'd against the arm d man 
the statue of the arm d knight 
she stood and listen'd to my lay 
amid the lingering light 

few sorrows hath she of her own
my hope my joy my genevieve 
she loves me best whene'er i sing
the songs that make her grieve 

i play'd a soft and doleful air 
i sang an old and moving story--
an old rude song that suited well
that ruin wild and hoary 

she listen'd with a flitting blush 
with downcast eyes and modest grace 
for well she knew i could not choose
but gaze upon her face 

i told her of the knight that wore
upon his shield a burning brand 
and that for ten long years he woo'd
the lady of the land 

i told her how he pined and ah 
the deep the low the pleading tone
with which i sang another's love 
interpreted my own 

she listen'd with a flitting blush 
with downcast eyes and modest grace 
and she forgave me that i gazed
too fondly on her face 

but when i told the cruel scorn
that crazed that bold and lovely knight 
and that he cross'd the mountain-woods 
nor rested day nor night 

that sometimes from the savage den 
and sometimes from the darksome shade 
and sometimes starting up at once
in green and sunny glade 

there came and look'd him in the face
an angel beautiful and bright 
and that he knew it was a fiend 
this miserable knight 

and that unknowing what he did 
he leap'd amid a murderous band 
and saved from outrage worse than death
the lady of the land 

and how she wept and clasp'd his knees 
and how she tended him in vain 
and ever strove to expiate
the scorn that crazed his brain 

and that she nursed him in a cave 
and how his madness went away 
when on the yellow forest-leaves
a dying man he lay 

--his dying words--but when i reach'd
that tenderest strain of all the ditty 
my faltering voice and pausing harp
disturb'd her soul with pity 

all impulses of soul and sense
had thrill'd my guileless genevieve 
the music and the doleful tale 
the rich and balmy eve 

and hopes and fears that kindle hope 
an undistinguishable throng 
and gentle wishes long subdued 
subdued and cherish'd long 

she wept with pity and delight 
she blush'd with love and virgin shame 
and like the murmur of a dream 
i heard her breathe my name 

her bosom heaved--she stepp'd aside 
as conscious of my look she stept--
then suddenly with timorous eye
she fled to me and wept 

she half enclosed me with her arms 
she press'd me with a meek embrace 
and bending back her head look'd up 
and gazed upon my face 

'twas partly love and partly fear 
and partly 'twas a bashful art 
that i might rather feel than see 
the swelling of her heart 

i calm'd her fears and she was calm 
and told her love with virgin pride 
and so i won my genevieve 
my bright and beauteous bride 








o talk not to me of a name great in story 
the days of our youth are the days of our glory 
and the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty
are worth all your laurels though ever so plenty 

what are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled 
'tis but as a dead flower with may-dew besprinkled 
then away with all such from the head that is hoary--
what care i for the wreaths that can only give glory 

o fame --if i e'er took delight in thy praises 
'twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases 
than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover
she thought that i was not unworthy to love her 

there chiefly i sought thee there only i found thee 
her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee 
when it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story 
i knew it was love and i felt it was glory 








o brignall banks are wild and fair 
and greta woods are green 
and you may gather garlands there
would grace a summer-queen 
and as i rode by dalton-hall
beneath the turrets high 
a maiden on the castle-wall
was singing merrily 
 o brignall banks are fresh and fair 
and greta woods are green 
i'd rather rove with edmund there
than reign our english queen 

 if maiden thou wouldst wend with me 
to leave both tower and town 
thou first must guess what life lead we
that dwell by dale and down 
and if thou canst that riddle read 
as read full well you may 
then to the greenwood shalt thou speed
as blithe as queen of may 
yet sung she brignall banks are fair 
and greta woods are green 
i'd rather rove with edmund there
than reign our english queen 

 i read you by your bugle-horn
and by your palfrey good 
i read you for a ranger sworn
to keep the king's greenwood 
 a ranger lady winds his horn 
and 'tis at peep of light 
his blast is heard at merry morn 
and mine at dead of night 
yet sung she brignall banks are fair 
and greta woods are gay 
i would i were with edmund there
to reign his queen of may 

 with burnish'd brand and musketoon
so gallantly you come 
i read you for a bold dragoon 
that lists the tuck of drum 
 i list no more the tuck of drum 
no more the trumpet hear 
but when the beetle sounds his hum
my comrades take the spear 
and o though brignall banks be fair 
and greta woods be gay 
yet mickle must the maiden dare 
would reign my queen of may 

 maiden a nameless life i lead 
a nameless death i'll die 
the fiend whose lantern lights the mead
were better mate than i 
and when i'm with my comrades met
beneath the greenwood bough 
what once we were we all forget 
nor think what we are now 

 chorus 

yet brignall banks are fresh and fair 
and greta woods are green 
and you may gather flowers there
would grace a summer-queen 








there be none of beauty's daughters
with a magic like thee 
and like music on the waters
is thy sweet voice to me 
when as if its sound were causing
the charm d ocean's pausing 
the waves lie still and gleaming 
and the lull'd winds seem dreaming
and the midnight moon is weaving
her bright chain o'er the deep 
whose breast is gently heaving 
as an infant's asleep 
so the spirit bows before thee
to listen and adore thee 
with a full but soft emotion 
like the swell of summer's ocean 








i arise from dreams of thee
in the first sweet sleep of night 
when the winds are breathing low
and the stars are shining bright 
i arise from dreams of thee 
and a spirit in my feet
hath led me--who knows how 
to thy chamber-window sweet 

the wandering airs they faint
on the dark the silent stream--
the champak odours fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream 
the nightingale's complaint 
it dies upon her heart 
as i must on thine 
oh belov d as thou art 

oh lift me from the grass 
i die i faint i fail 
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale 
my cheek is cold and white alas 
my heart beats loud and fast 
o press it to thine own again
where it will break at last 








she walks in beauty like the night
of cloudless climes and starry skies 
and all that's best of dark and bright
meets in her aspect and her eyes 
thus mellow'd to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies 

one shade the more one ray the less 
had half impair'd the nameless grace
which waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens o'er her face 
where thoughts serenely sweet express
how pure how dear their dwelling-place 

and on that cheek and o'er that brow
so soft so calm yet eloquent 
the smiles that win the tints that glow
but tell of days in goodness spent --
a mind at peace with all below 
a heart whose love is innocent 








she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleam'd upon my sight 
a lovely apparition sent
to be a moment's ornament 
her eyes as stars of twilight fair 
like twilight's too her dusky hair 
but all things else about her drawn
from may-time and the cheerful dawn 
a dancing shape an image gay 
to haunt to startle and waylay 

i saw her upon nearer view 
a spirit yet a woman too 
her household motions light and free 
and steps of virgin-liberty 
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records promises as sweet 
a creature not too bright or good
for human nature's daily food 
for transient sorrows simple wiles 
praise blame love kisses tears and smiles 

and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine 
a being breathing thoughtful breath 
a traveller between life and death 
the reason firm the temperate will 
endurance foresight strength and skill 
a perfect woman nobly plann'd 
to warn to comfort and command 
and yet a spirit still and bright
with something of an angel-light 








she is not fair to outward view
as many maidens be 
her loveliness i never knew
until she smiled on me 
o then i saw her eye was bright 
a well of love a spring of light 

but now her looks are coy and cold 
to mine they ne'er reply 
and yet i cease not to behold
the love-light in her eye 
her very frowns are fairer far
than smiles of other maidens are 








i fear thy kisses gentle maiden 
thou needest not fear mine 
my spirit is too deeply laden
ever to burthen thine 

i fear thy mien thy tones thy motion 
thou needest not fear mine 
innocent is the heart's devotion
with which i worship thine 








she dwelt among the untrodden ways
beside the springs of dove 
a maid whom there were none to praise 
and very few to love 

a violet by a mossy stone
half hidden from the eye 
--fair as a star when only one
is shining in the sky 

she lived unknown and few could know
when lucy ceased to be 
but she is in her grave and o 
the difference to me 








i travell'd among unknown men
in lands beyond the sea 
nor england did i know till then
what love i bore to thee 

'tis past that melancholy dream 
nor will i quit thy shore
a second time for still i seem
to love thee more and more 

among thy mountains did i feel
the joy of my desire 
and she i cherish'd turn'd her wheel
beside an english fire 

thy mornings showed thy nights conceal'd 
the bowers where lucy play'd 
and thine too is the last green field
that lucy's eyes survey'd 








three years she grew in sun and shower 
then nature said a lovelier flower
on earth was never sown 
this child i to myself will take 
she shall be mine and i will make
a lady of my own 

 myself will to my darling be
both law and impulse and with me
the girl in rock and plain 
in earth and heaven in glade and bower
shall feel an overseeing power
to kindle or restrain 

 she shall be sportive as the fawn
that wild with glee across the lawn
or up the mountain springs 
and her's shall be the breathing balm 
and her's the silence and the calm
of mute insensate things 

 the floating clouds their state shall lend
to her for her the willow bend 
nor shall she fail to see
e'en in the motions of the storm
grace that shall mould the maiden's form
by silent sympathy 

 the stars of midnight shall be dear
to her and she shall lean her ear
in many a secret place
where rivulets dance their wayward round 
and beauty born of murmuring sound
shall pass into her face 

 and vital feelings of delight
shall rear her form to stately height 
her virgin bosom swell 
such thoughts to lucy i will give
while she and i together live
here in this happy dell 

thus nature spake--the work was done--
how soon my lucy's race was run 
she died and left to me
this heath this calm and quiet scene 
the memory of what has been 
and never more will be 








a slumber did my spirit seal 
i had no human fears 
she seem'd a thing that could not feel
the touch of earthly years 

no motion has she now no force 
she neither hears nor sees 
roll'd round in earth's diurnal course
with rocks and stones and trees 








a chieftain to the highlands bound
cries boatman do not tarry 
and i'll give thee a silver pound
to row us o'er the ferry 

 now who be ye would cross lochgyle
this dark and stormy water 
 o i'm the chief of ulva's isle 
and this lord ullin's daughter 

 and fast before her father's men
three days we've fled together 
for should he find us in the glen 
my blood would stain the heather 

 his horsemen hard behind us ride--
should they our steps discover 
then who will cheer my bonny bride
when they have slain her lover 

out spoke the hardy highland wight
 i'll go my chief i'm ready 
it is not for your silver bright 
but for your winsome lady --

 and by my word the bonny bird
in danger not shall tarry 
so though the waves are raging white
i'll row you o'er the ferry 

by this the storm grew loud apace 
the water-wraith was shrieking 
and in the scowl of heaven each face
grew dark as they were speaking 

but still as wilder blew the wind
and as the night grew drearer 
adown the glen rode arm d men 
their trampling sounded nearer 

 o haste thee haste the lady cries 
 though tempests round us gather 
i'll meet the raging of the skies 
but not an angry father 

the boat has left a stormy land 
a stormy sea before her --
when o too strong for human hand
the tempest gather'd o'er her 

and still they row'd amidst the roar
of waters fast prevailing 
lord ullin reach'd that fatal shore --
his wrath was changed to wailing 

for sore dismay'd through storm and shade
his child he did discover --
one lovely hand she stretch'd for aid 
and one was round her lover 

 come back come back he cried in grief 
 across this stormy water 
and i'll forgive your highland chief 
my daughter --o my daughter 

'twas vain the loud waves lash'd the shore 
return or aid preventing 
the waters wild went o'er his child 
and he was left lamenting 








 why weep ye by the tide ladie 
why weep ye by the tide 
i'll wed ye to my youngest son 
and ye sall be his bride 
and ye sall be his bride ladie 
sae comely to be seen --
but aye she loot the tears doon fa'
for jock o' hazeldean 

 now let this wilfu' grief be done 
and dry that cheek so pale 
young frank is chief of errington
and lord of langley-dale 
his step is first in peaceful ha' 
his sword in battle keen --
but aye she loot the tears down fa'
for jock o' hazeldean 

 a chain of gold ye shall not lack 
nor braid to bind your hair 
nor mettled hound nor managed hawk
nor palfrey fresh and fair 
and you the foremost o' them a'
shall ride our forest queen --
but aye she loot the tears down fa'
for jock o' hazeldean 

the kirk was deck'd at morning-tide 
the tapers glimmer'd fair 
the priest and bridegroom wait the bride 
and dame and knight are there 
they sought her baith by bower and ha' 
the ladie was not seen 
she's o'er the border and awa'
wi' jock o' hazeldean 








how delicious is the winning
of a kiss at love's beginning 
when two mutual hearts are sighing
for the knot there's no untying 

yet remember 'midst your wooing 
love has bliss but love has ruing 
other smiles may make you fickle 
tears for other charms may trickle 

love he comes and love he tarries 
just as fate or fancy carries 
longest stays when sorest chidden 
laughs and flies when press'd and bidden 

bind the sea to slumber stilly 
bind its odour to the lily 
bind the aspen ne'er to quiver 
then bind love to last for ever 

love's a fire that needs renewal
of fresh beauty for its fuel 
love's wing moults when caged and captured 
only free he soars enraptured 

can you keep the bee from ranging
or the ringdove's neck from changing 
no nor fetter'd love from dying
in the knot there's no untying 








the fountains mingle with the river
and the rivers with the ocean 
the winds of heaven mix for ever
with a sweet emotion 
nothing in the world is single 
all things by a law divine
in one another's being mingle--
why not i with thine 

see the mountains kiss high heaven
and the waves clasp one another 
no sister-flower would be forgiven
if it disdain'd its brother 
and the sunlight clasps the earth 
and the moonbeams kiss the sea--
what are all these kissings worth 
if thou kiss not me 








how sweet the answer echo makes
to music at night
when roused by lute or horn she wakes 
and far away o'er lawns and lakes
goes answering light 

yet love hath echoes truer far
and far more sweet
than e'er beneath the moonlight's star 
of horn or lute or soft guitar
the songs repeat 

'tis when the sigh --in youth sincere
and only then 
the sigh that's breathed for one to hear--
is by that one that only dear
breathed back again 








ah county guy the hour is nigh 
the sun has left the lea 
the orange-flower perfumes the bower 
the breeze is on the sea 
the lark his lay who trill'd all day 
sits hush'd his partner nigh 
breeze bird and flower confess the hour 
but where is county guy 

the village maid steals through the shade
her shepherd's suit to hear 
to beauty shy by lattice high 
sings high-born cavalier 
the star of love all stars above 
now reigns o'er earth and sky 
and high and low the influence know--
but where is county guy 








gem of the crimson-colour'd even 
companion of retiring day 
why at the closing gates of heaven 
beloved star dost thou delay 

so fair thy pensile beauty burns
when soft the tear of twilight flows 
so due thy plighted love returns
to chambers brighter than the rose 

to peace to pleasure and to love
so kind a star thou seem'st to be 
sure some enamour'd orb above
descends and burns to meet with thee 

thine is the breathing blushing hour
when all unheavenly passions fly 
chased by the soul-subduing power
of love's delicious witchery 

o sacred to the fall of day
queen of propitious stars appear 
and early rise and long delay
when caroline herself is here 

shine on her chosen green resort
whose trees the sunward summit crown 
and wanton flowers that well may court
an angel's feet to tread them down --

shine on her sweetly scented road
thou star of evening's purple dome 
that lead'st the nightingale abroad 
and guid'st the pilgrim to his home 

shine where my charmer's sweeter breath
embalms the soft exhaling dew 
where dying winds a sigh bequeath
to kiss the cheek of rosy hue --

where winnow'd by the gentle air 
her silken tresses darkly flow
and fall upon her brow so fair 
like shadows on the mountain snow 

thus ever thus at day's decline
in converse sweet to wander far--
o bring with thee my caroline 
and thou shalt be my ruling star 








swiftly walk over the western wave 
spirit of night 
out of the misty eastern cave
where all the long and lone daylight
thou wovest dreams of joy and fear
which make thee terrible and dear --
swift be thy flight 

wrap thy form in a mantle gray 
star-inwrought 
blind with thine hair the eyes of day 
kiss her until she be wearied out 
then wander o'er city and sea and land 
touching all with thine opiate wand--
come long-sought 

when i arose and saw the dawn 
i sigh'd for thee 
when light rode high and the dew was gone 
and noon lay heavy on flower and tree 
and the weary day turn'd to his rest 
lingering like an unloved guest 
i sigh'd for thee 

thy brother death came and cried 
wouldst thou me 
thy sweet child sleep the filmy-eyed 
murmur'd like a noon-tide bee
shall i nestle near thy side 
wouldst thou me --and i replied
no not thee 

death will come when thou art dead 
soon too soon--
sleep will come when thou art fled 
of neither would i ask the boon
i ask of thee belov d night--
swift be thine approaching flight 
come soon soon 








why art thou silent is thy love a plant
of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
of absence withers what was once so fair 
is there no debt to pay no boon to grant 

yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant 
bound to thy service with unceasing care--
the mind's least generous wish a mendicant
for nought but what thy happiness could spare 

speak --though this soft warm heart once free to hold
a thousand tender pleasures thine and mine 
be left more desolate more dreary cold
than a forsaken bird's-nest fill'd with snow
'mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--
speak that my torturing doubts their end may know 








when we two parted
in silence and tears 
half broken-hearted
to sever for years 
pale grew thy cheek and cold 
colder thy kiss 
truly that hour foretold
sorrow to this 

the dew of the morning
sunk chill on my brow 
it felt like the warning
of what i feel now 
thy vows are all broken 
and light is thy fame 
i hear thy name spoken 
and share in its shame 

they name thee before me 
a knell to mine ear 
a shudder comes o'er me--
why wert thou so dear 
they know not i knew thee 
who knew thee too well 
long long shall i rue thee
too deeply to tell 

in secret we met 
in silence i grieve
that thy heart could forget 
thy spirit deceive 
if i should meet thee
after long years 
how should i greet thee --
with silence and tears 








in a drear-nighted december 
too happy happy tree
thy branches ne'er remember
their green felicity 
the north cannot undo them
with a sleety whistle through them 
nor frozen thawings glue them
from budding at the prime 

in a drear-nighted december
too happy happy brook
thy bubblings ne'er remember
apollo's summer look 
but with a sweet forgetting
they stay their crystal fretting 
never never petting
about the frozen time 

ah would 'twere so with many
a gentle girl and boy 
but were there ever any
writhed not at pass d joy 
to know the change and feel it 
when there is none to heal it
nor numb d sense to steal it--
was never said in rhyme 








where shall the lover rest
whom the fates sever
from his true maiden's breast
parted for ever 
where through groves deep and high
sounds the far billow 
where early violets die
under the willow 
eleu loro
soft shall be his pillow 

there through the summer day
cool streams are laving 
there while the tempests sway 
scarce are boughs waving 
there thy rest shalt thou take 
parted for ever 
never again to wake
never o never 
eleu loro
never o never 

where shall the traitor rest 
he the deceiver 
who would win maiden's breast 
ruin and leave her 
in the lost battle 
borne down by the flying 
where mingles war's rattle
with groans of the dying 
eleu loro
there shall he be lying 

her wing shall the eagle flap
o'er the falsehearted 
his warm blood the wolf shall lap
ere life be parted 
shame and dishonour sit
by his grave ever 
blessing shall hallow it
never o never 
eleu loro
never o never 








 o what can ail thee knight-at-arms 
alone and palely loitering 
the sedge has wither'd from the lake 
and no birds sing 

 o what can ail thee knight-at-arms 
so haggard and so woe-begone 
the squirrel's granary is full 
and the harvest's done 

 i see a lily on thy brow
with anguish moist and fever-dew 
and on thy cheeks a fading rose
fast withereth too 

 i met a lady in the meads 
full beautiful--a faery's child 
her hair was long her foot was light 
and her eyes were wild 

 i made a garland for her head 
and bracelets too and fragrant zone 
she look'd at me as she did love 
and made sweet moan 

 i set her on my pacing steed
and nothing else saw all day long 
for sidelong would she bend and sing
a faery's song 

 she found me roots of relish sweet 
and honey wild and manna-dew 
and sure in language strange she said 
'i love thee true '

 she took me to her elfin grot 
and there she wept and sigh'd full sore 
and there i shut her wild wild eyes
with kisses four 

 and there she lull d me asleep 
and there i dream'd--ah woe betide 
the latest dream i ever dream'd
on the cold hill's side 

 i saw pale kings and princes too 
pale warriors death-pale were they all 
they cried--'la belle dame sans merci
hath thee in thrall '

 i saw their starved lips in the gloam
with horrid warning gap d wide 
and i awoke and found me here 
on the cold hill's side 

 and this is why i sojourn here
alone and palely loitering 
though the sedge is wither'd from the lake 
and no birds sing 








 a weary lot is thine fair maid 
a weary lot is thine 
to pull the thorn thy brow to braid 
and press the rue for wine 
a lightsome eye a soldier's mien 
a feather of the blue 
a doublet of the lincoln green--
no more of me you knew 
my love 
no more of me you knew 

 the morn is merry june i trow 
the rose is budding fain 
but she shall bloom in winter snow
ere we two meet again 
he turn'd his charger as he spake
upon the river shore 
he gave the bridle-reins a shake 
said adieu for evermore 
my love 
and adieu for evermore 








when the lamp is shatter'd 
the light in the dust lies dead--
when the cloud is scatter'd 
the rainbow's glory is shed 
when the lute is broken 
sweet tones are remember'd not 
when the lips have spoken 
loved accents are soon forgot 

as music and splendour
survive not the lamp and the lute 
the heart's echoes render
no song when the spirit is mute--
no song but sad dirges 
like the wind through a ruin'd cell 
or the mournful surges
that ring the dead seaman's knell 

when hearts have once mingled 
love first leaves the well-built nest 
the weak one is singled
to endure what it once possest 
o love who bewailest
the frailty of all things here 
why choose you the frailest
for your cradle your home and your bier 

its passions will rock thee
as the storms rock the ravens on high 
bright reason will mock thee
like the sun from a wintry sky 
from thy nest every rafter
will rot and thine eagle home
leave thee naked to laughter 
when leaves fall and cold winds come 








o lovers' eyes are sharp to see 
and lovers' ears in hearing 
and love in life's extremity
can lend an hour of cheering 
disease had been in mary's bower
and slow decay from mourning 
though now she sits on neidpath's tower
to watch her love's returning 

all sunk and dim her eyes so bright 
her form decay'd by pining 
till through her wasted hand at night 
you saw the taper shining 
by fits a sultry hectic hue
across her cheek was flying 
by fits so ashy pale she grew
her maidens thought her dying 

yet keenest powers to see and hear
seem'd in her frame residing 
before the watch-dog prick'd his ear
she heard her lover's riding 
ere scarce a distant form was kenn'd
she knew and waved to greet him 
and o'er the battlement did bend
as on the wing to meet him 

he came--he pass'd--an heedless gaze
as o'er some stranger glancing 
her welcome spoke in faltering phrase 
lost in his courser's prancing--

the castle-arch whose hollow tone
returns each whisper spoken 
could scarcely catch the feeble moan
which told her heart was broken 








earl march look'd on his dying child 
and smit with grief to view her--
the youth he cried whom i exiled
shall be restored to woo her 

she's at the window many an hour
his coming to discover 
and he look'd up to ellen's bower
and she look'd on her lover--

but ah so pale he knew her not 
though her smile on him was dwelling--
and am i then forgot--forgot 
it broke the heart of ellen 

in vain he weeps in vain he sighs 
her cheek is cold as ashes 
nor love's own kiss shall wake those eyes
to lift their silken lashes 








bright star would i were steadfast as thou art--
not in lone splendour hung aloft the night 
and watching with eternal lids apart 
like nature's patient sleepless eremite 

the moving waters at their priestlike task
of pure ablution round earth's human shores 
or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
of snow upon the mountains and the moors --

no--yet still steadfast still unchangeable 
pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast
to feel for ever its soft fall and swell 
awake for ever in a sweet unrest 

still still to hear her tender-taken breath 
and so live ever --or else swoon to death 








when i have fears that i may cease to be
before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain 
before high-pil d books in charact'ry 
hold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain 

when i behold upon the night's starr'd face 
huge cloudy symbols of a high romance 
and think that i may never live to trace
their shadows with the magic hand of chance 

and when i feel fair creature of an hour 
that i shall never look upon thee more 
never have relish in the fairy power
of unreflecting love--then on the shore

of the wide world i stand alone and think 
till love and fame to nothingness do sink 








surprized by joy--impatient as the wind--
i turn'd to share the transport--oh with whom
but thee--deep buried in the silent tomb 
that spot which no vicissitude can find 

love faithful love recall'd thee to my mind--
but how could i forget thee through what power
even for the least division of an hour
have i been so beguiled as to be blind

to my most grievous loss --that thought's return
was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore
save one one only when i stood forlorn 

knowing my heart's best treasure was no more 
that neither present time nor years unborn
could to my sight that heavenly face restore 








at the mid hour of night when stars are weeping 
i fly
to the lone vale we loved when life shone warm in
thine eye 
and i think oft if spirits can steal from the regions
of air
to revisit past scenes of delight thou wilt come to
me there
and tell me our love is remember'd even in the sky 

then i sing the wild song it once was rapture to hear
when our voices commingling breathed like one on
the ear 
and as echo far off through the vale my sad orison
rolls 
i think o my love 'tis thy voice from the kingdom
of souls
faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear 








and thou art dead as young and fair
as aught of mortal birth 
and forms so soft and charms so rare
too soon return'd to earth 
though earth received them in her bed 
and o'er the spot the crowd may tread
in carelessness or mirth 
there is an eye which could not brook
a moment on that grave to look 

i will not ask where thou liest low
nor gaze upon the spot 
there flowers and weeds at will may grow
so i behold them not 
it is enough for me to prove
that what i loved and long must love
like common earth can rot 
to me there needs no stone to tell
'tis nothing that i loved so well 

yet did i love thee to the last 
as fervently as thou
who didst not change through all the past
and canst not alter now 
the love where death has set his seal
nor age can chill nor rival steal 
nor falsehood disavow 
and what were worse thou canst not see
or wrong or change or fault in me 

the better days of life were ours 
the worst can be but mine 
the sun that cheers the storm that lours
shall never more be thine 
the silence of that dreamless sleep
i envy now too much to weep 
nor need i to repine
that all those charms have pass'd away
i might have watch'd through long decay 

the flower in ripen'd bloom unmatch'd
must fall the earliest prey 
though by no hand untimely snatch'd 
the leaves must drop away 
and yet it were a greater grief
to watch it withering leaf by leaf 
than see it pluck'd to-day 
since earthly eye but ill can bear
to trace the change from foul to fair 

i know not if i could have borne
to see thy beauties fade 
the night that follow'd such a morn
had worn a deeper shade 
thy day without a cloud hath past 
and thou wert lovely to the last 
extinguish'd not decay'd 
as stars that shoot along the sky
shine brightest as they fall from high 

as once i wept if i could weep 
my tears might well be shed
to think i was not near to keep
one vigil o'er thy bed 
to gaze how fondly on thy face 
to fold thee in a faint embrace 
uphold thy drooping head 
and show that love however vain 
nor thou nor i can feel again 

yet how much less it were to gain 
though thou hast left me free 
the loveliest things that still remain
than thus remember thee 
the all of thine that cannot die
through dark and dread eternity
returns again to me 
and more thy buried love endears
than aught except its living years 








one word is too often profaned
for me to profane it 
one feeling too falsely disdain'd
for thee to disdain it 
one hope is too like despair
for prudence to smother 
and pity from thee more dear
than that from another 

i can give not what men call love 
but wilt thou accept not
the worship the heart lifts above
and the heavens reject not 
the desire of the moth for the star 
of the night for the morrow 
the devotion to something afar
from the sphere of our sorrow 








pibroch of donuil dhu
pibroch of donuil
wake thy wild voice anew 
summon clan conuil 
come away come away 
hark to the summons 
come in your war-array 
gentles and commons 

come from deep glen and
from mountain so rocky 
the war-pipe and pennon
are at inverlochy 
come every hill-plaid and
true heart that wears one 
come every steel blade and
strong hand that bears one 

leave untended the herd 
the flock without shelter 
leave the corpse uninterr'd 
the bride at the altar 
leave the deer leave the steer 
leave nets and barges 
come with your fighting gear 
broadswords and targes 

come as the winds come when
forests are rended 
come as the waves come when
navies are stranded 
faster come faster come 
faster and faster 
chief vassal page and groom 
tenant and master 

fast they come fast they come 
see how they gather 
wide waves the eagle plume
blended with heather 
cast your plaids draw your blades 
forward each man set 
pibroch of donuil dhu
knell for the onset 








a wet sheet and a flowing sea 
a wind that follows fast
and fills the white and rustling sail
and bends the gallant mast 
and bends the gallant mast my boys 
while like the eagle free
away the good ship flies and leaves
old england on the lee 

o for a soft and gentle wind 
i heard a fair one cry 
but give to me the snoring breeze
and white waves heaving high 
and white waves heaving high my lads 
the good ship tight and free--
the world of waters is our home 
and merry men are we 

there's tempest in yon horn d moon 
and lightning in yon cloud 
but hark the music mariners 
the wind is piping loud 
the wind is piping loud my boys 
the lightning flashes free--
while the hollow oak our palace is 
our heritage the sea 








ye mariners of england
that guard our native seas 
whose flag has braved a thousand years
the battle and the breeze 
your glorious standard launch again
to match another foe 
and sweep through the deep 
while the stormy winds do blow 
while the battle rages loud and long
and the stormy winds do blow 

the spirits of your fathers
shall start from every wave--
for the deck it was their field of fame 
and ocean was their grave 
where blake and mighty nelson fell
your manly hearts shall glow 
as ye sweep through the deep 
while the stormy winds do blow 
while the battle rages loud and long
and the stormy winds do blow 

britannia needs no bulwarks 
no towers along the steep 
her march is o'er the mountain waves 
her home is on the deep 
with thunders from her native oak
she quells the floods below--
as they roar on the shore 
when the stormy winds do blow 
when the battle rages loud and long
and the stormy winds do blow 

the meteor flag of england
shall yet terrific burn 
till danger's troubled night depart
and the star of peace return 
then then ye ocean-warriors 
our song and feast shall flow
to the fame of your name 
when the storm has ceased to blow 
when the fiery fight is heard no more 
and the storm has ceased to blow 








of nelson and the north
sing the glorious day's renown 
when to battle fierce came forth
all the might of denmark's crown 
and her arms along the deep proudly shone 
by each gun the lighted brand
in a bold determined hand 
and the prince of all the land
led them on 

like leviathans afloat
lay their bulwarks on the brine 
while the sign of battle flew
on the lofty british line 
it was ten of april morn by the chime 
as they drifted on their path
there was silence deep as death 
and the boldest held his breath
for a time 

but the might of england flush'd
to anticipate the scene 
and her van the fleeter rush'd
o'er the deadly space between 
 hearts of oak our captains cried when each gun
from its adamantine lips
spread a death-shade round the ships 
like the hurricane eclipse
of the sun 

again again again 
and the havoc did not slack 
till a feeble cheer the dane
to our cheering sent us back --
their shots along the deep slowly boom --
then ceased--and all is wail 
as they strike the shatter'd sail 
or in conflagration pale
light the gloom 

out spoke the victor then
as he hail'd them o'er the wave 
 ye are brothers ye are men 
and we conquer but to save --
so peace instead of death let us bring 
but yield proud foe thy fleet
with the crews at england's feet 
and make submission meet
to our king 

then denmark blest our chief
that he gave her wounds repose 
and the sounds of joy and grief
from her people wildly rose 
as death withdrew his shades from the day 
while the sun look'd smiling bright
o'er a wide and woeful sight 
where the fires of funeral light
died away 

now joy old england raise 
for the tidings of thy might 
by the festal cities' blaze 
whilst the wine-cup shines in light 
and yet amidst that joy and uproar 
let us think of them that sleep
full many a fathom deep
by thy wild and stormy steep 
elsinore 

brave hearts to britain's pride
once so faithful and so true 
on the deck of fame that died
with the gallant good riou 
soft sigh the winds of heaven o'er their grave 
while the billow mournful rolls
and the mermaid's song condoles
singing glory to the souls
of the brave 








stern daughter of the voice of god 
o duty if that name thou love
who art a light to guide a rod
to check the erring and reprove 
thou who art victory and law
when empty terrors overawe 
from vain temptations dost set free 
and calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity 

there are who ask not if thine eye
be on them who in love and truth
where no misgiving is rely
upon the genial sense of youth 
glad hearts without reproach or blot 
who do thy work and know it not 
oh if through confidence misplaced
they fail thy saving arms dread power around them cast 

serene will be our days and bright
and happy will our nature be
when love is an unerring light 
and joy its own security 
and they a blissful course may hold
ev'n now who not unwisely bold 
live in the spirit of this creed 
yet find that other strength according to their need 

i loving freedom and untried 
no sport of every random gust 
yet being to myself a guide 
too blindly have reposed my trust 
and oft when in my heart was heard
thy timely mandate i deferr'd
the task in smoother walks to stray 
but thee i now would serve more strictly if i may 

through no disturbance of my soul
or strong compunction in me wrought 
i supplicate for thy controul 
but in the quietness of thought 
me this uncharter'd freedom tires 
i feel the weight of chance desires 
my hopes no more must change their name 
i long for a repose which ever is the same 

stern lawgiver yet thou dost wear
the godhead's most benignant grace 
nor know we anything so fair
as is the smile upon thy face 
flowers laugh before thee on their beds 
and fragrance in thy footing treads 
thou dost preserve the stars from wrong 
and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong 

to humbler functions awful power 
i call thee i myself commend
unto thy guidance from this hour 
o let my weakness have an end 
give unto me made lowly wise 
the spirit of self-sacrifice 
the confidence of reason give 
and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live 








eternal spirit of the chainless mind 
brightest in dungeons liberty thou art--
for there thy habitation is the heart--
the heart which love of thee alone can bind 

and when thy sons to fetters are consign'd 
to fetters and the damp vault's dayless gloom 
their country conquers with their martyrdom
and freedom's fame finds wings on every wind 

chillon thy prison is a holy place
and thy sad floor an altar for 'twas trod
until his very steps have left a trace

worn as if thy cold pavement were a sod 
by bonnivard may none those marks efface 
for they appeal from tyranny to god 










two voices are there one is of the sea 
one of the mountains each a mighty voice 
in both from age to age thou didst rejoice 
they were thy chosen music liberty 

there came a tyrant and with holy glee
thou fought'st against him --but hast vainly striven 
thou from thy alpine holds at length are driven
where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee 

--of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft 
then cleave o cleave to that which still is left--
for high-soul'd maid what sorrow would it be

that mountain floods should thunder as before 
and ocean bellow from his rocky shore 
and neither awful voice be heard by thee 








once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
and was the safeguard of the west the worth
of venice did not fall below her birth 
venice the eldest child of liberty 

she was a maiden city bright and free 
no guile seduced no force could violate 
and when she took unto herself a mate 
she must espouse the everlasting sea 

and what if she had seen those glories fade 
those titles vanish and that strength decay --
yet shall some tribute of regret be paid

when her long life hath reach'd its final day 
men are we and must grieve when even the shade
of that which once was great has pass'd away 








o friend i know not which way i must look
for comfort being as i am opprest
to think that now our life is only drest
for show mean handiwork of craftsman cook 

or groom --we must run glittering like a brook
in the open sunshine or we are unblest 
the wealthiest man among us is the best 
no grandeur now in nature or in book

delights us rapine avarice expense 
this is idolatry and these we adore 
plain living and high thinking are no more 

the homely beauty of the good old cause
is gone our peace our fearful innocence 
and pure religion breathing household laws 








milton thou shouldst be living at this hour 
england hath need of thee she is a fen
of stagnant waters altar sword and pen 
fireside the heroic wealth of hall and bower 

have forfeited their ancient english dower
of inward happiness we are selfish men
o raise us up return to us again 
and give us manners virtue freedom power 

thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart 
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea 
pure as the naked heavens majestic free 

so didst thou travel on life's common way
in cheerful godliness and yet thy heart
the lowliest duties on herself did lay 








when i have borne in memory what has tamed
great nations how ennobling thoughts depart
when men change swords for ledgers and desert
the student's bower for gold --some fears unnamed

i had my country --am i to be blamed 
now when i think of thee and what thou art 
verily in the bottom of my heart
of those unfilial fears i am ashamed 

for dearly must we prize thee we who find
in thee a bulwark of the cause of men 
and i by my affection was beguiled 

what wonder if a poet now and then 
among the many movements of his mind 
felt for thee as a lover or a child 








on linden when the sun was low 
all bloodless lay the untrodden snow 
and dark as winter was the flow
of iser rolling rapidly 

but linden saw another sight 
when the drum beat at dead of night
commanding fires of death to light
the darkness of her scenery 

by torch and trumpet fast array'd
each horseman drew his battle-blade 
and furious every charger neigh'd
to join the dreadful revelry 

then shook the hills with thunder riven 
then rush'd the steed to battle driven 
and louder than the bolts of heaven
far flash'd the red artillery 

but redder yet that light shall glow
on linden's hills of stain d snow 
and bloodier yet the torrent flow
of iser rolling rapidly 

'tis morn but scarce yon level sun
can pierce the war-clouds rolling dun 
where furious frank and fiery hun
shout in their sulphurous canopy 

the combat deepens on ye brave
who rush to glory or the grave 
wave munich all thy banners wave 
and charge with all thy chivalry 

few few shall part where many meet 
the snow shall be their winding-sheet 
and every turf beneath their feet
shall be a soldier's sepulchre 








it was a summer evening 
old kaspar's work was done 
and he before his cottage door
was sitting in the sun 
and by him sported on the green
his little grandchild wilhelmine 

she saw her brother peterkin
roll something large and round
which he beside the rivulet
in playing there had found
he came to ask what he had found
that was so large and smooth and round 

old kaspar took it from the boy
who stood expectant by 
and then the old man shook his head 
and with a natural sigh
 'tis some poor fellow's skull said he 
 who fell in the great victory 

 i find then in the garden 
for there's many here about 
and often when i go to plough
the ploughshare turns them out 
for many thousand men said he 
 were slain in that great victory 

 now tell us what 'twas all about 
young peterkin he cries 
and little wilhelmine looks up
with wonder-waiting eyes 
 now tell us all about the war 
and what they fought each other for 

 it was the english kaspar cried 
 who put the french to rout 
but what they fought each other for
i could not well make out 
but every body said quoth he 
 that 'twas a famous victory 

 my father lived at blenheim then 
yon little stream hard by 
they burnt his dwelling to the ground 
and he was forced to fly 
so with his wife and child he fled 
nor had he where to rest his head 

 with fire and sword the country round
was wasted far and wide 
and many a childing mother then
and newborn baby died 
but things like that you know must be
at every famous victory 

 they say it was a shocking sight
after the field was won 
for many thousand bodies here
lay rotting in the sun 
but things like that you know must be
after a famous victory 

 great praise the duke of marlbro' won
and our good prince eugene 
 why 'twas a very wicked thing 
said little wilhelmine 
 nay--nay--my little girl quoth he 
 it was a famous victory 

and every body praised the duke
who this great fight did win 
 but what good came of it at last 
quoth little peterkin --
 why that i cannot tell said he 
 but 'twas a famous victory 








when he who adores thee has left but the name
of his fault and his sorrows behind 
o say wilt thou weep when they darken the fame
of a life that for thee was resign'd 
yes weep and however my foes may condemn 
thy tears shall efface their decree 
for heaven can witness though guilty to them 
i have been but too faithful to thee 

with thee were the dreams of my earliest love 
every thought of my reason was thine 
in my last humble prayer to the spirit above
thy name shall be mingled with mine 
o blest are the lovers and friends who shall live
the days of thy glory to see 
but the next dearest blessing that heaven can give
is the pride of thus dying for thee 








not a drum was heard not a funeral note 
as his corpse to the rampart we hurried 
not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
o'er the grave where our hero we buried 

we buried him darkly at dead of night 
the sods with our bayonets turning 
by the struggling moonbeam's misty light
and the lantern dimly burning 

no useless coffin enclosed his breast 
not in sheet or in shroud we wound him 
but he lay like a warrior taking his rest 
with his martial cloak around him 

few and short were the prayers we said
and we spoke not a word of sorrow 
but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead 
and we bitterly thought of the morrow 

we thought as we hollow'd his narrow bed
and smooth'd down his lonely pillow 
that the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head 
and we far away on the billow 

lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone 
and o'er his cold ashes upbraid him--
but little he'll reck if they let him sleep on
in the grave where a briton has laid him 

but half of our heavy task was done
when the clock struck the hour for retiring 
and we heard the distant and random gun
that the foe was sullenly firing 

slowly and sadly we laid him down 
from the field of his fame fresh and gory 
we carved not a line and we raised not a stone 
but we left him alone with his glory 








in the sweet shire of cardigan 
not far from pleasant ivor hall 
an old man dwells a little man 
i've heard he once was tall 
full five-and-thirty years he lived
a running huntsman merry 
and still the centre of his cheek
is red as a ripe cherry 

no man like him the horn could sound 
and hill and valley rang with glee 
when echo bandied round and round
the halloo of simon lee 
in those proud days he little cared
for husbandry or tillage 
to blither tasks did simon rouse
the sleepers of the village 

he all the country could outrun 
could leave both man and horse behind 
and often ere the chase was done 
he reel'd and was stone-blind 
and still there's something in the world
at which his heart rejoices 
for when the chiming hounds are out 
he dearly loves their voices 

but o the heavy change --bereft
of health strength friends and kindred see
old simon to the world is left
in liveried poverty 
his master's dead and no one now
dwells in the hall of ivor 
men dogs and horses all are dead 
he is the sole survivor 

and he is lean and he is sick 
his body dwindled and awry
rests upon ankles swoln and thick 
his legs are thin and dry 
he has no son he has no child 
his wife an aged woman 
lives with him near the waterfall 
upon the village common 

beside their moss-grown hut of clay 
not twenty paces from the door 
a scrap of land they have but they
are poorest of the poor 
this scrap of land he from the heath
enclosed when he was stronger 
but what avails the land to them
which he can till no longer 

oft working by her husband's side 
ruth does what simon cannot do 
for she with scanty cause for pride 
is stouter of the two 
and though you with your utmost skill
from labour could not wean them 
'tis little very little all
that they can do between them 

few months of life has he in store
as he to you will tell 
for still the more he works the more
do his weak ankles swell 
my gentle reader i perceive
how patiently you've waited 
and now i fear that you expect
some tale will be related 

o reader had you in your mind
such stores as silent thought can bring 
o gentle reader you would find
a tale in everything 
what more i have to say is short 
and you must kindly take it 
it is no tale but should you think 
perhaps a tale you'll make it 

one summer-day i chanced to see
this old man doing all he could
to unearth the root of an old tree 
a stump of rotten wood 
the mattock totter'd in his hand
so vain was his endeavour
that at the root of the old tree
he might have work'd for ever 

 you're overtask'd good simon lee 
give me your tool to him i said 
and at the word right gladly he
received my proffer'd aid 
i struck and with a single blow
the tangled root i sever'd 
at which the poor old man so long
and vainly had endeavour'd 

the tears into his eyes were brought 
and thanks and praises seem'd to run
so fast out of his heart i thought
they never would have done 
--i've heard of hearts unkind kind deeds
with coldness still returning 
alas the gratitude of men
has oftener left me mourning 








i have had playmates i have had companions
in my days of childhood in my joyful school-days 
all all are gone the old familiar faces 

i have been laughing i have been carousing 
drinking late sitting late with my bosom cronies 
all all are gone the old familiar faces 

i loved a love once fairest among women 
closed are her doors on me i must not see her--
all all are gone the old familiar faces 

i have a friend a kinder friend has no man 
like an ingrate i left my friend abruptly 
left him to muse on the old familiar faces 

ghost-like i paced round the haunts of my childhood 
earth seem'd a desert i was bound to traverse 
seeking to find the old familiar faces 

friend of my bosom thou more than a brother 
why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling 
so might we talk of the old familiar faces 

how some they have died and some they have left me 
and some are taken from me all are departed 
all all are gone the old familiar faces 








as slow our ship her foamy track
against the wind was cleaving 
her trembling pennant still look'd back
to that dear isle 'twas leaving 
so loth we part from all we love 
from all the links that bind us 
so turn our hearts as on we rove 
to those we've left behind us 

when round the bowl of vanish'd years
we talk with joyous seeming--
with smiles that might as well be tears 
so faint so sad their beaming 
while memory brings us back again
each early tie that twined us 
oh sweet's the cup that circles then
to those we've left behind us 

and when in other climes we meet
some isle or vale enchanting 
where all looks flowery wild and sweet 
and nought but love is wanting 
we think how great had been our bliss
if heaven had but assign'd us
to live and die in scenes like this 
with some we've left behind us 

as travellers oft look back at eve
when eastward darkly going 
to gaze upon that light they leave
still faint behind them glowing --
so when the close of pleasure's day
to gloom hath near consign'd us 
we turn to catch our fading ray
of joy that's left behind us 








there's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
when the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay 
'tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone which fades so fast 
but the tender bloom of heart is gone ere youth itself be past 

then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess 
the magnet of their course is gone or only points in vain
the shore to which their shiver'd sail shall never stretch again 

then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down 
it cannot feel for others' woes it dare not dream its own 
that heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears 
and though the eye may sparkle still 'tis where the ice appears 

though wit may flash from fluent lips and mirth distract the breast 
through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest 
'tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruin'd turret wreathe 
all green and wildly fresh without but worn and gray beneath 

o could i feel as i have felt or be what i have been 
or weep as i could once have wept o'er many a vanish'd scene --
as springs in deserts found seem sweet all brackish though they be 
so midst the wither'd waste of life those tears would flow to me 








there is a flower the lesser celandine 
that shrinks like many more from cold and rain 
and the first moment that the sun may shine 
bright as the sun himself 'tis out again 

when hailstones have been falling swarm on swarm 
or blasts the green field and the trees distrest 
oft have i seen it muffled up from harm
in close self-shelter like a thing at rest 

but lately one rough day this flower i past 
and recognised it though an alter'd form 
now standing forth an offering to the blast 
and buffeted at will by rain and storm 

i stopp'd and said with inly-mutter'd voice 
 it doth not love the shower nor seek the cold 
this neither is its courage nor its choice 
but its necessity in being old 

 the sunshine may not cheer it nor the dew 
it cannot help itself in its decay 
stiff in its members wither'd changed of hue 
and in my spleen i smiled that it was gray 

to be a prodigal's favourite--then worse truth 
a miser's pensioner--behold our lot 
o man that from thy fair and shining youth
age might but take the things youth needed not 








i remember i remember
the house where i was born 
the little window where the sun
came peeping in at morn 
he never came a wink too soon
nor brought too long a day 
but now i often wish the night
had borne my breath away 

i remember i remember
the roses red and white 
the violets and the lily-cups--
those flowers made of light 
the lilacs where the robin built 
and where my brother set
the laburnum on his birthday --
the tree is living yet 

i remember i remember
where i was used to swing 
and thought the air must rush as fresh
to swallows on the wing 
my spirit flew in feathers then
that is so heavy now 
and summer pools could hardly cool
the fever on my brow 

i remember i remember
the fir trees dark and high 
i used to think their slender tops
were close against the sky 
it was a childish ignorance 
but now 'tis little joy
to know i'm farther off from heaven
than when i was a boy 








oft in the stilly night 
ere slumber's chain has bound me 
fond memory brings the light
of other days around me 
the smiles the tears
of boyhood's years 
the words of love then spoken 
the eyes that shone 
now dimm'd and gone 
the cheerful hearts now broken 
thus in the stilly night 
ere slumber's chain has bound me 
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me 

when i remember all
the friends so link'd together 
i've seen around me fall
like leaves in wintry weather 
i feel like one
who treads alone
some banquet-hall deserted 
whose lights are fled 
whose garlands dead 
and all but he departed 
thus in the stilly night 
ere slumber's chain has bound me 
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me 








rarely rarely comest thou 
spirit of delight 
wherefore hast thou left me now
many a day and night 
many a weary night and day
'tis since thou art fled away 

how shall ever one like me
win thee back again 
with the joyous and the free
thou wilt scoff at pain 
spirit false thou hast forgot
all but those who need thee not 

as a lizard with the shade
of a trembling leaf 
thou with sorrow art dismay'd 
even the sighs of grief
reproach thee that thou art not near 
and reproach thou wilt not hear 

let me set my mournful ditty
to a merry measure --
thou wilt never come for pity 
thou wilt come for pleasure --
pity then will cut away
those cruel wings and thou wilt stay 

i love all that thou lovest 
spirit of delight 
the fresh earth in new leaves drest
and the starry night 
autumn evening and the morn
when the golden mists are born 

i love snow and all the forms
of the radiant frost 
i love waves and winds and storms 
everything almost
which is nature's and may be
untainted by man's misery 

i love tranquil solitude 
and such society
as is quiet wise and good 
between thee and me
what diff'rence but thou dost possess
the things i seek not love them less 

i love love--though he has wings 
and like light can flee 
but above all other things 
spirit i love thee--
thou art love and life o come 
make once more my heart thy home 








the sun is warm the sky is clear 
the waves are dancing fast and bright 
blue isles and snowy mountains wear
the purple noon's transparent light 
the breath of the moist air is light
around its unexpanded buds 
like many a voice of one delight--
the winds' the birds' the ocean-floods'--
the city's voice itself is soft like solitude's 

i see the deep's untrampled floor
with green and purple sea-weeds strown 
i see the waves upon the shore
like light dissolved in star-showers thrown 
i sit upon the sands alone 
the lightning of the noon-tide ocean
is flashing round me and a tone
arises from its measured motion--
how sweet did any heart now share in my emotion 

alas i have nor hope nor health 
nor peace within nor calm around 
nor that content surpassing wealth 
the sage in meditation found 
and walked with inward glory crown'd--
nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure 
others i see whom these surround--
smiling they live and call life pleasure 
to me that cup has been dealt in another measure 

yet now despair itself is mild
even as the winds and waters are 
i could lie down like a tired child 
and weep away the life of care
which i have borne and yet must bear 
till death like sleep might steal on me 
and i might feel in the warm air
my cheek grow cold and hear the sea
breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony 








my days among the dead are past 
around me i behold 
where'er these casual eyes are cast 
the mighty minds of old 
my never-failing friends are they 
with whom i converse day by day 

with them i take delight in weal
and seek relief in woe 
and while i understand and feel
how much to them i owe 
my cheeks have often been bedew'd
with tears of thoughtful gratitude 

my thoughts are with the dead with them
i live in long-past years 
their virtues love their faults condemn 
partake their hopes and fears 
and from their lessons seek and find
instruction with an humble mind 

my hopes are with the dead anon
my place with them will be 
and i with them shall travel on
through all futurity 
yet leaving here a name i trust 
that will not perish in the dust 








souls of poets dead and gone
what elysium have ye known 
happy field or mossy cavern 
choicer than the mermaid tavern 
have ye tippled drink more fine
than mine host's canary wine 
or are fruits of paradise
sweeter than those dainty pies
of venison o generous food 
drest as though bold robin hood
would with his maid marian 
sup and browse from horn and can 

i have heard that on a day
mine host's signboard flew away
nobody knew whither till
an astrologer's old quill
to a sheepskin gave the story--
said he saw you in your glory
underneath a new-old sign
sipping beverage divine 
and pledging with contented smack
the mermaid in the zodiac 
souls of poets dead and gone
what elysium have ye known--
happy field or mossy cavern--
choicer than the mermaid tavern 








proud maisie is in the wood 
walking so early 
sweet robin sits on the bush 
singing so rarely 

 tell me thou bonny bird 
when shall i marry me 
-- when six braw gentlemen
kirkward shall carry ye 

 who makes the bridal bed 
birdie say truly 
-- the gray-headed sexton
that delves the grave duly 

 the glowworm o'er grave and stone
shall light thee steady 
the owl from the steeple sing
welcome proud lady 








one more unfortunate
weary of breath
rashly importunate 
gone to her death 

take her up tenderly 
lift her with care 
fashion'd so slenderly
young and so fair 

look at her garments
clinging like cerements 
whilst the wave constantly
drips from her clothing 
take her up instantly 
loving not loathing 

touch her not scornfully 
think of her mournfully 
gently and humanly 
not of the stains of her--
all that remains of her
now is pure womanly 

make no deep scrutiny
into her mutiny
rash and undutiful 
past all dishonour 
death has left on her
only the beautiful 

still for all slips of hers 
one of eve's family--
wipe those poor lips of hers
oozing so clammily 

loop up her tresses
escaped from the comb 
her fair auburn tresses 
whilst wonderment guesses
where was her home 

who was her father 
who was her mother 
had she a sister 
had she a brother 
or was there a dearer one
still and a nearer one
yet than all other 

alas for the rarity
of christian charity
under the sun 
o it was pitiful 
near a whole city full 
home she had none 

sisterly brotherly 
fatherly motherly
feelings had changed 
love by harsh evidence 
thrown from its eminence 
even god's providence
seeming estranged 

where the lamps quiver
so far in the river 
with many a light
from window and casement 
from garret to basement 
she stood with amazement 
houseless by night 

the bleak wind of march
made her tremble and shiver 
but not the dark arch 
or the black flowing river 
mad from life's history 
glad to death's mystery 
swift to be hurl'd--
any where any where
out of the world 

in she plunged boldly 
no matter how coldly
the rough river ran 
over the brink of it --
picture it think of it 
dissolute man 
lave in it drink of it 
then if you can 

take her up tenderly 
lift her with care 
fashion'd so slenderly 
young and so fair 

ere her limbs frigidly
stiffen too rigidly 
decently kindly 
smooth and compose them 
and her eyes close them 
staring so blindly 

dreadfully staring
thro' muddy impurity 
as when with the daring
last look of despairing
fix'd on futurity 

perishing gloomily 
spurr'd by contumely 
cold inhumanity 
burning insanity 
into her rest 
--cross her hands humbly
as if praying dumbly 
over her breast 

owning her weakness 
her evil behaviour 
and leaving with meekness 
her sins to her saviour 








o snatch'd away in beauty's bloom 
on thee shall press no ponderous tomb 
but on thy turf shall roses rear
their leaves the earliest of the year 
and the wild cypress wave in tender gloom 

and oft by yon blue gushing stream
shall sorrow lean her drooping head 
and feed deep thought with many a dream 
and lingering pause and lightly tread 
fond wretch as if her step disturb'd the dead 

away we know that tears are vain 
that death nor heeds nor hears distress 
will this unteach us to complain 
or make one mourner weep the less 
and thou who tell'st me to forget 
thy looks are wan thine eyes are wet 








when maidens such as hester die
their place ye may not well supply 
though ye among a thousand try
with vain endeavour 
a month or more hath she been dead 
yet cannot i by force be led
to think upon the wormy bed
and her together 

a springy motion in her gait 
a rising step did indicate
of pride and joy no common rate 
that flush'd her spirit 
i know not by what name beside
i shall it call if 'twas not pride 
it was a joy to that allied 
she did inherit 

her parents held the quaker rule
which doth the human feeling cool 
but she was train'd in nature's school 
nature had blest her 
a waking eye a prying mind 
a heart that stirs is hard to bind 
a hawk's keen sight ye cannot blind 
ye could not hester 

my sprightly neighbour gone before
to that unknown and silent shore 
shall we not meet as heretofore
some summer morning--
when from thy cheerful eyes a ray
hath struck a bliss upon the day 
a bliss that would not go away 
a sweet fore-warning 








he is gone on the mountain 
he is lost to the forest
like a summer-dried fountain 
when our need was the sorest 
the fount reappearing
from the raindrops shall borrow 
but to us comes no cheering 
to duncan no morrow 

the hand of the reaper
take the ears that are hoary 
but the voice of the weeper
wails manhood in glory 
the autumn winds rushing
waft the leaves that are serest 
but our flower was in flushing
when blighting was nearest 

fleet foot on the correi 
sage counsel in cumber 
red hand in the foray 
how sound is thy slumber 
like the dew on the mountain 
like the foam on the river 
like the bubble on the fountain 
thou art gone and for ever 








we watch'd her breathing thro' the night 
her breathing soft and low 
as in her breast the wave of life
kept heaving to and fro 

but when the morn came dim and sad
and chill with early showers 
her quiet eyelids closed--she had
another morn than ours 








o listen listen ladies gay 
no haughty feat of arms i tell 
soft is the note and sad the lay
that mourns the lovely rosabelle 

 moor moor the barge ye gallant crew 
and gentle lady deign to stay 
rest thee in castle ravensheuch 
nor tempt the stormy firth to-day 

 the blackening wave is edged with white 
to inch and rock the sea-mews fly 
the fishers have heard the water-sprite 
whose screams forbode that wreck is nigh 

 last night the gifted seer did view
a wet shroud swathed round lady gay 
then stay thee fair in ravensheuch 
why cross the gloomy firth to-day 

 'tis not because lord lindesay's heir
to-night at roslin leads the ball 
but that my lady-mother there
sits lonely in her castle-hall 

 'tis not because the ring they ride 
and lindesay at the ring rides well 
but that my sire the wine will chide
if 'tis not fill'd by rosabelle 

--o'er roslin all that dreary night
a wondrous blaze was seen to gleam 
'twas broader than the watch-fire's light 
and redder than the bright moonbeam 

it glared on roslin's castled rock 
it ruddied all the copse-wood glen 
'twas seen from dryden's grove of oak 
and seen from cavern'd hawthornden 

seem'd all on fire that chapel proud
where roslin's chiefs uncoffin'd lie 
each baron for a sabled shroud 
sheathed in his iron panoply 

seem'd all on fire within around 
deep sacristy and altar's pale 
shone every pillar foliage-bound 
and glimmer'd all the dead men's mail 

blazed battlement and pinnet high 
blazed every rose-carved buttress fair--
so still they blaze when fate is nigh
the lordly line of high saint clair 

there are twenty of roslin's baron's bold
lie buried within that proud chapelle 
each one the holy vault doth hold 
but the sea holds lovely rosabelle 

and each saint clair was buried there
with candle with book and with knell 
but the sea-caves rung and the wild winds sung
the dirge of lovely rosabelle 








i saw where in the shroud did lurk
a curious frame of nature's work 
a flow'ret crush d in the bud 
a nameless piece of babyhood
was in her cradle-coffin lying 
extinct with scarce the sense of dying 
so soon to exchange the imprisoning womb
for darker closets of the tomb 
she did but ope an eye and put
a clear beam forth then straight up shut
for the long dark ne'er more to see
through glasses of mortality 
riddle of destiny who can show
what thy short visit meant or know
what thy errand here below 
shall we say that nature blind
check'd her hand and changed her mind
just when she had exactly wrought
a finish'd pattern without fault 
could she flag or could she tire 
or lack'd she the promethean fire
 with her nine moons' long workings sicken'd 
that should thy little limbs have quicken'd 
limbs so firm they seem'd to assure
life of health and days mature 
woman's self in miniature 
limbs so fair they might supply
 themselves now but cold imagery 
the sculptor to make beauty by 
or did the stern-eyed fate descry
that babe or mother one must die 
so in mercy left the stock
and cut the branch to save the shock
of young years widow'd and the pain
when single state comes back again
to the lone man who reft of wife 
thenceforward drags a maim d life 
the economy of heaven is dark 
and wisest clerks have miss'd the mark
why human buds like this should fall 
more brief than fly ephemeral
that has his day while shrivell'd crones
stiffen with age to stocks and stones 
and crabb d use the conscience sears
in sinners of an hundred years 
--mother's prattle mother's kiss 
baby fond thou ne'er wilt miss 
rites which custom does impose 
silver bells and baby clothes 
coral redder than those lips
which pale death did late eclipse 
music framed for infants' glee 
whistle never tuned for thee 
though thou want'st not thou shalt have them 
loving hearts were they which gave them 
let not one be missing nurse 
see them laid upon the hearse
of infant slain by doom perverse 
why should kings and nobles have
pictured trophies to their grave 
and we churls to thee deny
thy pretty toys with thee to lie--
a more harmless vanity 








where art thou my beloved son 
where art thou worse to me than dead 
oh find me prosperous or undone 
or if the grave be now thy bed 
why am i ignorant of the same
that i may rest and neither blame
nor sorrow may attend thy name 

seven years alas to have received
no tidings of an only child--
to have despair'd have hoped believed 
and be for evermore beguiled --
sometimes with thoughts of very bliss 
i catch at them and then i miss 
was ever darkness like to this 

he was among the prime in worth 
an object beauteous to behold 
well born well bred i sent him forth
ingenuous innocent and bold 
if things ensued that wanted grace 
as hath been said they were not base 
and never blush was on my face 

ah little doth the young-one dream 
when full of play and childish cares 
what power is in his wildest scream 
heard by his mother unawares 
he knows it not he cannot guess 
years to a mother bring distress 
but do not make her love the less 

neglect me no i suffer'd long
from that ill thought and being blind
said pride shall help me in my wrong 
kind mother have i been as kind
as ever breathed and that is true 
i've wet my path with tears like dew 
weeping for him when no one knew 

my son if thou be humbled poor 
hopeless of honour and of gain 
o do not dread thy mother's door 
think not of me with grief and pain 
i now can see with better eyes 
and worldly grandeur i despise
and fortune with her gifts and lies 

alas the fowls of heaven have wings
and blasts of heaven will aid their flight 
they mount--how short a voyage brings
the wanderers back to their delight 
chains tie us down by land and sea 
and wishes vain as mine may be
all that is left to comfort thee 

perhaps some dungeon hears thee groan
maim'd mangled by inhuman men 
or thou upon a desert thrown
inheritest the lion's den 
or hast been summoned to the deep 
thou thou and all thy mates to keep
an incommunicable sleep 

i look for ghosts but none will force
their way to me 'tis falsely said
that there was ever intercourse
between the living and the dead 
for surely then i should have sight
of him i wait for day and night
with love and longings infinite 

my apprehensions come in crowds 
i dread the rustling of the grass 
the very shadows of the clouds
have power to shake me as they pass 
i question things and do not find
one that will answer to my mind 
and all the world appears unkind 

beyond participation lie
my troubles and beyond relief 
if any chance to heave a sigh
they pity me and not my grief 
then come to me my son or send
some tidings that my woes may end 
i have no other earthly friend 








waken lords and ladies gay 
on the mountain dawns the day 
all the jolly chase is here
with hawk and horse and hunting-spear 
hounds are in their couples yelling 
hawks are whistling horns are knelling 
merrily merrily mingle they 
 waken lords and ladies gay 

waken lords and ladies gay 
the mist has left the mountains gray 
springlets in the dawn are streaming 
diamonds on the brake are gleaming 
and foresters have busy been
to track the buck in thicket green 
now we come to chant our lay
 waken lords and ladies gay 

waken lords and ladies gay 
to the greenwood haste away 
we can show you where he lies 
fleet of foot and tall of size 
we can show the marks he made
when 'gainst the oak his antlers fray'd 
you shall see him brought to bay 
 waken lords and ladies gay 

louder louder chant the lay
waken lords and ladies gay 
tell them youth and mirth and glee
run a course as well as we 
time stern huntsman who can baulk 
staunch as hound and fleet as hawk 
think of this and rise with day
gentle lords and ladies gay 








ethereal minstrel pilgrim of the sky 
dost thou despise the earth where cares abound 
or while the wings aspire are heart and eye
both with thy nest upon the dewy ground 
thy nest which thou canst drop into at will 
those quivering wings composed that music still 

to the last point of vision and beyond 
mount daring warbler --that love-prompted strain
--'twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond--
thrills not the less the bosom of the plain 
yet might'st thou seem proud privilege to sing
all independent of the leafy spring 

leave to the nightingale her shady wood 
a privacy of glorious light is thine 
whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
of harmony with instinct more divine 
type of the wise who soar but never roam--
true to the kindred points of heaven and home 








hail to thee blithe spirit 
bird thou never wert 
that from heaven or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art 

higher still and higher
from the earth thou springest 
like a cloud of fire 
the blue deep thou wingest 
and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest 

in the golden lightning
of the sunken sun
o'er which clouds are brightening 
thou dost float and run 
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun 

the pale purple even
melts around thy flight 
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight 

keen as are the arrows
of that silver sphere 
whose intense lamp narrows
in the white dawn clear
until we hardly see we feel that it is there 

all the earth and air
with thy voice is loud 
as when night is bare 
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams and heaven is overflow'd 

what thou art we know not 
what is most like thee 
from rainbow clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody 

like a poet hidden
in the light of thought 
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not 

like a high-born maiden
in a palace tower 
soothing her love-laden
soul in secret hour
with music sweet as love which overflows her bower 

like a glow-worm golden
in a dell of dew 
scattering unbeholden
its aerial hue
among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view 

like a rose embower'd
in its own green leaves 
by warm winds deflower'd 
till the scent it gives
makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-wing d thieves 

sound of vernal showers
on the twinkling grass 
rain-awaken'd flowers 
all that ever was
joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass 

teach us sprite or bird 
what sweet thoughts are thine 
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine 

chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chaunt
match'd with thine would be all
but an empty vaunt--
a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want 

what objects are the fountains
of thy happy strain 
what fields or waves or mountains 
what shapes of sky or plain 
what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain 

with thy clear keen joyance
languor cannot be 
shadow of annoyance
never came near thee 
thou lovest but ne'er knew love's sad satiety 

waking or asleep
thou of death must deem
things more true and deep
than we mortals dream 
or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream 

we look before and after 
and pine for what is not 
our sincerest laughter
with some pain is fraught 
our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought 

yet if we could scorn
hate and pride and fear 
if we were things born
not to shed a tear 
i know not how thy joy we ever should come near 

better than all measures
of delightful sound 
better than all treasures
that in books are found 
thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground 

teach me half the gladness
that thy brain must know 
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then as i am listening now 








beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
their snow white blossoms on my head 
with brightest sunshine round me spread
of spring's unclouded weather 
in this sequester'd nook how sweet
to sit upon my orchard-seat 
and birds and flowers once more to greet 
my last year's friends together 

one have i mark'd the happiest guest
in all this covert of the blest 
hail to thee far above the rest
in joy of voice and pinion 
thou linnet in thy green array 
presiding spirit here to-day
dost lead the revels of the may 
and this is thy dominion 

while birds and butterflies and flowers
make all one band of paramours 
thou ranging up and down the bowers
art sole in thy employment 
a life a presence like the air 
scattering thy gladness without care 
too blest with any one to pair 
thyself thy own enjoyment 

amid yon tuft of hazel trees 
that twinkle to the gusty breeze 
behold him perch'd in ecstasies 
yet seeming still to hover 
there where the flutter of his wings
upon his back and body flings
shadows and sunny glimmerings 
that cover him all over 

my dazzled sight he oft deceives--
a brother of the dancing leaves 
then flits and from the cottage-eaves
pours forth his song in gushes 
as if by that exulting strain
he mock'd and treated with disdain
the voiceless form he chose to feign
while fluttering in the bushes 








o blithe new-comer i have heard 
i hear thee and rejoice 
o cuckoo shall i call thee bird 
or but a wandering voice 

while i am lying on the grass
thy twofold shout i hear 
from hill to hill it seems to pass 
at once far off and near 

though babbling only to the vale
of sunshine and of flowers 
thou bringest unto me a tale
of visionary hours 

thrice welcome darling of the spring 
even yet thou art to me
no bird but an invisible thing 
a voice a mystery 

the same whom in my school-boy days
i listen'd to that cry
which made me look a thousand ways
in bush and tree and sky 

to seek thee did i often rove
through woods and on the green 
and thou wert still a hope a love 
still long'd for never seen 

and i can listen to thee yet 
can lie upon the plain
and listen till i do beget
that golden time again 

o bless d bird the earth we pace
again appears to be
an unsubstantial fairy place 
that is fit home for thee 








my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains
my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk 
or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
one minute past and lethe-wards had sunk 
'tis not through envy of thy happy lot 
but being too happy in thine happiness --
that thou light-wing d dryad of the trees 
in some melodious plot
of beechen green and shadows numberless 
singest of summer in full-throated ease 

o for a draught of vintage that hath been
cool'd a long age in the deep-delv d earth 
tasting of flora and the country-green 
dance and proven al song and sunburnt mirth 
o for a beaker full of the warm south 
full of the true the blushful hippocrene 
with beaded bubbles winking at the brim
and purple-stain d mouth 
that i might drink and leave the world unseen 
and with thee fade away into the forest dim 

fade far away dissolve and quite forget
what thou among the leaves hast never known 
the weariness the fever and the fret
here where men sit and hear each other groan 
where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs 
where youth grows pale and spectre-thin and dies 
where but to think is to be full of sorrow
and leaden-eyed despairs 
where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes 
or new love pine at them beyond to-morrow 

away away for i will fly to thee 
not charioted by bacchus and his pards 
but on the viewless wings of poesy 
though the dull brain perplexes and retards 
already with thee tender is the night 
and haply the queen-moon is on her throne 
cluster'd around by all her starry fays 
but here there is no light
save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways 

i cannot see what flowers are at my feet 
nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs 
but in embalm d darkness guess each sweet
wherewith the seasonable month endows
the grass the thicket and the fruit-tree wild 
white hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine 
fast-fading violets cover'd up in leaves 
and mid-may's eldest child 
the coming musk-rose full of dewy wine 
the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves 

darkling i listen and for many a time
i have been half in love with easeful death 
call'd him soft names in many a mus d rhyme 
to take into the air my quiet breath 
now more than ever seems it rich to die 
to cease upon the midnight with no pain 
while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
in such an ecstasy 
still wouldst thou sing and i have ears in vain--
to thy high requiem become a sod 

thou wast not born for death immortal bird 
no hungry generations tread thee down 
the voice i hear this passing night was heard
in ancient days by emperor and clown 
perhaps the self-same song that found a path
through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home 
she stood in tears amid the alien corn 
the same that oft-times hath
charm'd magic casements opening on the foam
of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn 

forlorn the very word is like a bell
to toll me back from thee to my sole self 
adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well
as she is famed to do deceiving elf 
adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades
past the near meadows over the still stream 
up the hill-side and now 'tis buried deep
in the next valley-glades 
was it a vision or a waking dream 
fled is that music --do i wake or sleep 








 sept 

earth has not anything to show more fair 
dull would he be of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in its majesty 
this city now doth like a garment wear
the beauty of the morning silent bare 
ships towers domes theatres and temples lie
open unto the fields and to the sky 
all bright and glittering in the smokeless air 

never did sun more beautifully steep
in his first splendour valley rock or hill 
ne'er saw i never felt a calm so deep 

the river glideth at his own sweet will 
dear god the very houses seem asleep 
and all that mighty heart is lying still 








i met a traveller from an antique land
who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert near them on the sand
half sunk a shatter'd visage lies whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive stamp'd on these lifeless things 
the hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed 
and on the pedestal these words appear 
 my name is ozymandias king of kings 
look on my works ye mighty and despair 
nothing beside remains round the decay
of that colossal wreck boundless and bare
the lone and level sands stretch far away 









degenerate douglas o the unworthy lord 
whom mere despite of heart could so far please
and love of havoc for with such disease
fame taxes him that he could send forth word

to level with the dust a noble horde 
a brotherhood of venerable trees 
leaving an ancient dome and towers like these
beggar'd and outraged --many hearts deplored

the fate of those old trees and oft with pain
the traveller at this day will stop and gaze
on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed 

for shelter'd places bosoms nooks and bays 
and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed 
and the green silent pastures yet remain 








yes there is holy pleasure in thine eye 
--the lovely cottage in the guardian nook
hath stirr'd thee deeply with its own dear brook 
its own small pasture almost its own sky 

but covet not the abode--o do not sigh
as many do repining while they look 
intruders who would tear from nature's book
this precious leaf with harsh impiety 

--think what the home would be if it were thine 
even thine though few thy wants --roof window door 
the very flowers are sacred to the poor 

the roses to the porch which they entwine 
yea all that now enchants thee from the day
on which it should be touch'd would melt away 








sweet highland girl a very shower
of beauty is thy earthly dower 
twice seven consenting years have shed
their utmost bounty on thy head 
and these grey rocks this household lawn 
these trees--a veil just half withdrawn 
this fall of water that doth make
a murmur near the silent lake 
this little bay a quiet road
that holds in shelter thy abode 
in truth together ye do seem
like something fashion'd in a dream 
such forms as from their covert peep
when earthly cares are laid asleep 
but o fair creature in the light
of common day so heavenly bright 
i bless thee vision as thou art 
i bless thee with a human heart 
god shield thee to thy latest years 
i neither know thee nor thy peers 
and yet my eyes are fill'd with tears 

with earnest feeling i shall pray
for thee when i am far away 
for never saw i mien or face
in which more plainly i could trace
benignity and home-bred sense
ripening in perfect innocence 
here scatter'd like a random seed 
remote from men thou dost not need
the embarrass'd look of shy distress 
and maidenly shamefacedness 
thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
the freedom of a mountaineer 
a face with gladness overspread 
soft smiles by human kindness bred 
and seemliness complete that sways
thy courtesies about thee plays 
with no restraint but such as springs
from quick and eager visitings
of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
of thy few words of english speech 
a bondage sweetly brook'd a strife
that gives thy gestures grace and life 
so have i not unmoved in mind 
seen birds of tempest-loving kind 
thus beating up against the wind 

what hand but would a garland cull
for thee who art so beautiful 
o happy pleasure here to dwell
beside thee in some heathy dell 
adopt your homely ways and dress 
a shepherd thou a shepherdess 
but i could frame a wish for thee
more like a grave reality 
thou art to me but as a wave
of the wild sea and i would have
some claim upon thee if i could 
though but of common neighbourhood 
what joy to hear thee and to see 
thy elder brother i would be 
thy father anything to thee 

now thanks to heaven that of its grace
hath led me to this lonely place 
joy have i had and going hence
i bear away my recompense 
in spots like these it is we prize
our memory feel that she hath eyes 
then why should i be loth to stir 
i feel this place was made for her 
to give new pleasure like the past 
continued long as life shall last 
nor am i loth though pleased at heart 
sweet highland girl from thee to part 
for i methinks till i grow old
as fair before me shall behold
as i do now the cabin small 
the lake the bay the waterfall 
and thee the spirit of them all 








behold her single in the field 
yon solitary highland lass 
reaping and singing by herself 
stop here or gently pass 
alone she cuts and binds the grain 
and sings a melancholy strain 
o listen for the vale profound
is overflowing with the sound 

no nightingale did ever chaunt
more welcome notes to weary bands
of travellers in some shady haunt 
among arabian sands 
no sweeter voice was ever heard
in spring-time from the cuckoo-bird 
breaking the silence of the seas
among the farthest hebrides 

will no one tell me what she sings 
perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
for old unhappy far-off things 
and battles long ago 
or is it some more humble lay 
familiar matter of to-day 
some natural sorrow loss or pain 
that has been and may be again 

whate'er the theme the maiden sang
as if her song could have no ending 
i saw her singing at her work 
and o'er the sickle bending 
i listen'd till i had my fill 
and as i mounted up the hill 
the music in my heart i bore
long after it was heard no more 








at the corner of wood street when daylight appears
hangs a thrush that sings loud it has sung for three years 
poor susan has pass'd by the spot and has heard
in the silence of morning the song of the bird 

'tis a note of enchantment what ails her she sees
a mountain ascending a vision of trees 
bright volumes of vapour through lothbury glide 
and a river flows on through the vale of cheapside 

green pastures she views in the midst of the dale
down which she so often has tripp'd with her pail 
and a single small cottage a nest like a dove's 
the one only dwelling on earth that she loves 

she looks and her heart is in heaven but they fade
the mist and the river the hill and the shade 
the stream will not flow and the hill will not rise 
and the colours have all pass'd away from her eyes 








ariel to miranda --take
this slave of music for the sake
of him who is the slave of thee 
and teach it all the harmony
in which thou canst and only thou 
make the delighted spirit glow 
till joy denies itself again
and too intense is turn'd to pain 
for by permission and command
of thine own prince ferdinand 
poor ariel sends this silent token
of more than ever can be spoken 
your guardian spirit ariel who
from life to life must still pursue
your happiness for thus alone
can ariel ever find his own 
from prospero's enchanted cell 
as the mighty verses tell 
to the throne of naples he
lit you o'er the trackless sea 
flitting on your prow before 
like a living meteor 
when you die the silent moon 
in her interlunar swoon
is not sadder in her cell
than deserted ariel 
when you live again on earth 
like an unseen star of birth
ariel guides you o'er the sea
of life from your nativity --
many changes have been run
since ferdinand and you begun
your course of love and ariel still
has track'd your steps and served your will 
now in humbler happier lot 
this is all remember'd not 
and now alas the poor sprite is
imprison'd for some fault of his
in a body like a grave--
from you he only dares to crave
for his service and his sorrow
a smile to-day a song to-morrow 

the artist who this viol wrought
to echo all harmonious thought 
fell'd a tree while on the steep
the woods were in their winter sleep 
rock'd in that repose divine
on the wind-swept apennine 
and dreaming some of autumn past 
and some of spring approaching fast 
and some of april buds and showers 
and some of songs in july bowers 
and all of love and so this tree --
o that such our death may be --
died in sleep and felt no pain 
to live in happier form again 
from which beneath heaven's fairest star 
the artist wrought this loved guitar 
and taught it justly to reply
to all who question skilfully
in language gentle as thine own 
whispering in enamour'd tone
sweet oracles of woods and dells 
and summer winds in sylvan cells 
--for it had learnt all harmonies
of the plains and of the skies 
of the forests and the mountains 
and the many-voic d fountains 
the clearest echoes of the hills 
the softest notes of falling rills 
the melodies of birds and bees 
the murmuring of summer seas 
and pattering rain and breathing dew 
and airs of evening and it knew
that seldom-heard mysterious sound
which driven on its diurnal round 
as it floats through boundless day 
our world enkindles on its way 
--all this it knows but will not tell
to those who cannot question well
the spirit that inhabits it 
it talks according to the wit
of its companions and no more
is heard than has been felt before
by those who tempt it to betray
these secrets of an elder day 
but sweetly as its answers will
flatter hands of perfect skill 
it keeps its highest holiest tone
for one beloved friend alone 








i wander'd lonely as a cloud
that floats on high o'er vales and hills 
when all at once i saw a crowd 
a host of golden daffodils 
beside the lake beneath the trees 
fluttering and dancing in the breeze 

continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way 
they stretch'd in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay 
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance 

the waves beside them danced but they
out-did the sparkling waves in glee --
a poet could not but be gay
in such a jocund company 
i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought 

for oft when on my couch i lie
in vacant or in pensive mood 
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude 
and then my heart with pleasure fills 
and dances with the daffodils 








with little here to do or see
of things that in the great world be 
sweet daisy oft i talk to thee
for thou art worthy 
thou unassuming commonplace
of nature with that homely face 
and yet with something of a grace 
which love makes for thee 

oft on the dappled turf at ease
i sit and play with similes 
loose types of things through all degrees 
thoughts of thy raising 
and many a fond and idle name
i give to thee for praise or blame 
as is the humour of the game 
while i am gazing 

a nun demure of lowly port 
or sprightly maiden of love's court 
in thy simplicity the sport
of all temptations 
a queen in crown of rubies drest 
a starveling in a scanty vest 
are all as seem to suit thee best 
thy appellations 

a little cyclops with one eye
staring to threaten and defy 
that thought comes next--and instantly
the freak is over 
the shape will vanish and behold 
a silver shield with boss of gold
that spreads itself some fairy bold
in fight to cover 

i see thee glittering from afar--
and then thou art a pretty star 
not quite so fair as many are
in heaven above thee 
yet like a star with glittering crest 
self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest --
may peace come never to his nest 
who shall reprove thee 

sweet flower for by that name at last
when all my reveries are past
i call thee and to that cleave fast 
sweet silent creature 
that breath'st with me in sun and air 
do thou as thou art wont repair
my heart with gladness and a share
of thy meek nature 








season of mists and mellow fruitfulness 
close bosom-friend of the maturing sun 
conspiring with him how to load and bless
with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run 
to bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees 
and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core 
to swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells
with a sweet kernel to set budding more
and still more later flowers for the bees 
until they think warm days will never cease 
for summer has o'erbrimm'd their clammy cells 

who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store 
sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
thee sitting careless on a granary floor 
thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind 
or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep 
drowsed with the fume of poppies while thy hook
spares the next swath and all its twin d flowers 
and sometime like a gleaner thou dost keep
steady thy laden head across a brook 
or by a cider-press with patient look 
thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours 

where are the songs of spring ay where are they 
think not of them --thou hast thy music too 
while barr d clouds bloom the soft-dying day
and touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue 
then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
among the river sallows borne aloft
or sinking as the light wind lives or dies 
and full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn 
hedge-crickets sing and now with treble soft
the redbreast whistles from a garden croft 
and gathering swallows twitter in the skies 








 germany december 

when first the fiery mantled sun
his heavenly race began to run 
round the earth and ocean blue
his children four the seasons flew --
first in green apparel dancing 
the young spring smiled with angel-grace 
rosy summer next advancing 
rush'd into her sire's embrace--
her bright-hair'd sire who bade her keep
for ever nearest to his smiles 
on calpe's olive-shaded steep
or india's citron-cover'd isles 
more remote and buxom-brown 
the queen of vintage bow'd before his throne 
a rich pomegranate gemm'd her crown 
a ripe sheaf bound her zone 

but howling winter fled afar
to hills that prop the polar star 
and loves on deer-borne car to ride
with barren darkness at his side
round the shore where loud lofoden
whirls to death the roaring whale 
round the hall where runic odin
howls his war-song to the gale--
save when adown the ravaged globe
he travels on his native storm 
deflowering nature's grassy robe
and trampling on her faded form 
till light's returning lord assume
the shaft that drives him to his northern fields 
of power to pierce his raven plume
and crystal-cover'd shield 

o sire of storms whose savage ear
the lapland drum delights to hear 
when frenzy with her bloodshot eye
implores thy dreadful deity--
archangel power of desolation 
fast descending as thou art 
say hath mortal invocation
spells to touch thy stony heart 
then sullen winter hear my prayer 
and gently rule the ruin'd year 
nor chill the wanderer's bosom bare
nor freeze the wretch's falling tear 
to shuddering want's unmantled bed
thy horror-breathing agues cease to lend 
and gently on the orphan head
of innocence descend 

but chiefly spare o king of clouds 
the sailor on his airy shrouds 
when wrecks and beacons strew the deep
and spectres walk along the deep 
milder yet thy snowy breezes
pour on yonder tented shores 
where the rhine's broad billow freezes 
or the dark-brown danube roars 
o winds of winter list ye there
to many a deep and dying groan 
or start ye demons of the midnight air 
at shrieks and thunders louder than your own 
alas e'en your unhallow'd breath
may spare the victim fallen low 
but man will ask no truce to death 
no bounds to human woe 










from stirling castle we had seen
the mazy forth unravell'd 
had trod the banks of clyde and tay 
and with the tweed had travell'd 
and when we came to clovenford 
then said my winsome marrow 
 whate'er betide we'll turn aside 
and see the braes of yarrow 

 let yarrow folk frae selkirk town 
who have been buying selling 
go back to yarrow 'tis their own 
each maiden to her dwelling 
on yarrow's banks let herons feed 
hares couch and rabbits burrow 
but we will downward with the tweed 
nor turn aside to yarrow 

 there's galla water leader haughs 
both lying right before us 
and dryburgh where with chiming tweed
the lintwhites sing in chorus 
there's pleasant tiviotdale a land
made blythe with plough and harrow 
why throw away a needful day
to go in search of yarrow 

 what's yarrow but a river bare
that glides the dark hills under 
there are a thousand such elsewhere
as worthy of your wonder 
--strange words they seem'd of slight and scorn 
my true-love sighed for sorrow 
and look'd me in the face to think
i thus could speak of yarrow 

 o green said i are yarrow's holms 
and sweet is yarrow flowing 
fair hangs the apple frae the rock 
but we will leave it growing 
o'er hilly path and open strath 
we'll wander scotland thorough 
but though so near we will not turn
into the dale of yarrow 

 let beeves and home-bred kine partake
the sweets of burn-mill meadow 
the swan on still saint mary's lake
float double swan and shadow 
we will not see them will not go
to-day nor yet to-morrow 
enough if in our hearts we know
there's such a place as yarrow 

 be yarrow stream unseen unknown 
it must or we shall rue it 
we have a vision of our own 
ah why should we undo it 
the treasured dreams of times long past 
we'll keep them winsome marrow 
for when we're there although 'tis fair 
'twill be another yarrow 

 if care with freezing years should come
and wandering seem but folly --
should we be loth to stir from home 
and yet be melancholy 
should life be dull and spirits low 
'twill soothe us in our sorrow
that earth has something yet to show 
the bonny holms of yarrow 








 september 

and is this--yarrow --this is the stream
of which my fancy cherish'd
so faithfully a waking dream 
an image that hath perish'd 
o that some minstrel's harp were near
to utter notes of gladness
and chase this silence from the air 
that fills my heart with sadness 

yet why --a silvery current flows
with uncontroll'd meanderings 
nor have these eyes by greener hills
been soothed in all my wanderings 
and through her depths saint mary's lake
is visibly delighted 
for not a feature of those hills
is in the mirror slighted 

a blue sky bends o'er yarrow vale 
save where that pearly whiteness
is round the rising sun diffused 
a tender hazy brightness 
mild dawn of promise that excludes
all profitless dejection 
though not unwilling here to admit
a pensive recollection 

where was it that the famous flower
of yarrow vale lay bleeding 
his bed perchance was yon smooth mound
on which the herd is feeding 
and haply from this crystal pool 
now peaceful as the morning 
the water-wraith ascended thrice 
and gave his doleful warning 

delicious is the lay that sings
the haunts of happy lovers 
the path that leads them to the grove 
the leafy grove that covers 
and pity sanctifies the verse
that paints by strength of sorrow 
the unconquerable strength of love 
bear witness rueful yarrow 

but thou that didst appear so fair
to fond imagination
dost rival in the light of day
her delicate creation 
meek loveliness is round thee spread 
a softness still and holy 
the grace of forest charms decay'd 
and pastoral melancholy 

that region left the vale unfolds
rich groves of lofty stature 
with yarrow winding through the pomp
of cultivated nature 
and rising from those lofty groves
behold a ruin hoary 
the shatter'd front of newark's towers 
renown'd in border story 

fair scenes for childhood's opening bloom 
for sportive youth to stray in 
for manhood to enjoy his strength 
and age to wear away in 
yon cottage seems a bower of bliss 
a covert for protection
of studious ease and generous cares 
and every chaste affection 

how sweet on this autumnal day
the wild-wood fruits to gather 
and on my true-love's forehead plant
a crest of blooming heather 
and what if i enwreathed my own 
'twere no offence to reason 
the sober hills thus deck their brows
to meet the wintry season 

i see--but not by sight alone
loved yarrow have i won thee 
a ray of fancy still survives--
her sunshine plays upon thee 
thy ever-youthful waters keep
a course of lively pleasure 
and gladsome notes my lips can breathe
accordant to the measure 

the vapours linger round the heights 
they melt and soon must vanish 
one hour is theirs nor more is mine--
sad thought which i would banish 
but that i know where'er i go 
thy genuine image yarrow 
will dwell with me to heighten joy
and cheer my mind in sorrow 








best and brightest come away 
fairer far than this fair day 
which like thee to those in sorrow
comes to bid a sweet good-morrow
to the rough year just awake
in its cradle on the brake 
the brightest hour of unborn spring
through the winter wandering 
found it seems the halcyon morn
to hoar february born 
bending from heaven in azure mirth 
it kiss'd the forehead of the earth 
and smiled upon the silent sea 
and bade the frozen streams be free 
and waked to music all their fountains 
and breathed upon the frozen mountains 
and like a prophetess of may
strew'd flowers upon the barren way 
making the wintry world appear
like one on whom thou smilest dear 

away away from men and towns 
to the wild wood and the downs--
to the silent wilderness
where the soul need not repress
its music lest it should not find
an echo in another's mind 
while the touch of nature's art
harmonises heart to heart 

radiant sister of the day
awake arise and come away 
to the wild woods and the plains 
and the pools where winter rains
image all their roof of leaves 
where the pine its garland weaves
of sapless green and ivy dun 
round stems that never kiss the sun 
where the lawns and pastures be
and the sandhills of the sea 
where the melting hoar-frost wets
the daisy-star that never sets 
and wind-flowers and violets
which yet join not scent to hue
crown the pale year weak and new 
when the night is left behind
in the deep east dim and blind 
and the blue noon is over us 
and the multitudinous
billows murmur at our feet 
where the earth and ocean meet 
and all things seem only one
in the universal sun 








now the last day of many days
all beautiful and bright as thou 
the loveliest and the last is dead 
rise memory and write its praise 
up do thy wonted work come trace
the epitaph of glory fled 
for now the earth has changed its face 
a frown is on the heaven's brow 

we wander'd to the pine forest
that skirts the ocean's foam 
the lightest wind was in its nest 
the tempest in its home 
the whispering waves were half asleep 
the clouds were gone to play 
and on the bosom of the deep
the smile of heaven lay 
it seem'd as if the hour were one
sent from beyond the skies
which scatter'd from above the sun
a light of paradise 

we paused amid the pines that stood
the giants of the waste 
tortured by storms to shapes as rude
as serpents interlaced --
and soothed by every azure breath
that under heaven is blown
to harmonies and hues beneath 
as tender as its own 
now all the tree-tops lay asleep
like green waves on the sea 
as still as in the silent deep
the ocean-woods may be 

how calm it was --the silence there
by such a chain was bound 
that even the busy woodpecker
made stiller by her sound
the inviolable quietness 
the breath of peace we drew
with its soft motion made not less
the calm that round us grew 
there seem'd from the remotest seat
of the wide mountain waste
to the soft flower beneath our feet
a magic circle traced
a spirit interfused around 
a thrilling silent life 
to momentary peace it bound
our mortal nature's strife --
and still i felt the centre of
the magic circle there
was one fair form that fill'd with love
the lifeless atmosphere 

we paused beside the pools that lie
under the forest bough 
each seemed as 'twere a little sky
gulf'd in a world below 
a firmament of purple light
which in the dark earth lay 
more boundless than the depth of night
and purer than the day--
in which the lovely forests grew
as in the upper air 
more perfect both in shape and hue
than any spreading there 
there lay the glade and neighbouring lawn 
and through the dark green wood
the white sun twinkling like the dawn
out of a speckled cloud 
sweet views which in our world above
can never well be seen
were imaged by the water's love
of that fair forest green 
and all was interfused beneath
with an elysian glow 
an atmosphere without a breath 
a softer day below 
like one beloved the scene had lent
to the dark water's breast
its very leaf and lineament
with more than truth exprest 
until an envious wind crept by 
like an unwelcome thought
which from the mind's too faithful eye
blots one dear image out 
--though thou art ever fair and kind 
the forests ever green 
less oft is peace in shelley's mind 
than calm in waters seen 








it is a beauteous evening calm and free 
the holy time is quiet as a nun
breathless with adoration the broad sun
is sinking down in its tranquillity 

the gentleness of heaven is on the sea 
listen the mighty being is awake 
and doth with his eternal motion make
a sound like thunder--everlastingly 

dear child dear girl that walkest with me here 
if thou appear untouch'd by solemn thought
thy nature is not therefore less divine 

thou liest in abraham's bosom all the year 
and worshipp'st at the temple's inner shrine 
god being with thee when we know it not 








star that bringest home the bee 
and sett'st the weary labourer free 
if any star shed peace 'tis thou
that send'st it from above 
appearing when heaven's breath and brow
are sweet as hers we love 

come to the luxuriant skies 
whilst the landscape's odours rise 
whilst far-off lowing herds are heard
and songs when toil is done 
from cottages whose smoke unstirr'd
curls yellow in the sun 

star of love's soft interviews 
parted lovers on thee muse 
their remembrancer in heaven
of thrilling vows thou art 
too delicious to be riven
by absence from the heart 








the sun upon the lake is low 
the wild birds hush their song 
the hills have evening's deepest glow 
yet leonard tarries long 
now all whom varied toil and care
from home and love divide 
in the calm sunset may repair
each to the loved one's side 

the noble dame on turret high 
who waits her gallant knight 
looks to the western beam to spy
the flash of armour bright 
the village maid with hand on brow
the level ray to shade 
upon the footpath watches now
for colin's darkening plaid 

now to their mates the wild swans row 
by day they swam apart 
and to the thicket wanders slow
the hind beside the hart 
the woodlark at his partner's side
twitters his closing song--
all meet whom day and care divide 
but leonard tarries long 








art thou pale for weariness
of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth 
wandering companionless
among the stars that have a different birth --
and ever-changing like a joyless eye
that finds no object worth its constancy 








a widow bird sate mourning for her love
upon a wintry bough 
the frozen wind crept on above 
the freezing stream below 

there was no leaf upon the forest bare 
no flower upon the ground 
and little motion in the air
except the mill-wheel's sound 








a flock of sheep that leisurely pass by
one after one the sound of rain and bees
murmuring the fall of rivers winds and seas 
smooth fields white sheets of water and pure sky --

i've thought of all by turns and still i lie
sleepless and soon the small birds' melodies
must hear first utter'd from my orchard trees 
and the first cuckoo's melancholy cry 

even thus last night and two nights more i lay 
and could not win thee sleep by any stealth 
so do not let me wear to-night away 

without thee what is all the morning's wealth 
come bless d barrier between day and day 
dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health 








our bugles sang truce for the night-cloud had lower'd 
and the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky 
and thousands had sunk on the ground overpower'd 
the weary to sleep and the wounded to die 

when reposing that night on my pallet of straw
by the wolf-scaring faggot that guarded the slain 
at the dead of the night a sweet vision i saw 
and thrice ere the morning i dreamt it again 

methought from the battle-field's dreadful array
far far i had roam'd on a desolate track 
'twas autumn --and sunshine arose on the way
to the home of my fathers that welcomed me back 

i flew to the pleasant fields traversed so oft
in life's morning march when my bosom was young 
i heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft 
and knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung 

then pledged we the wine-cup and fondly i swore
from my home and my weeping friends never to part 
my little ones kiss'd me a thousand times o'er 
and my wife sobb'd aloud in her fulness of heart 

 stay--stay with us --rest --thou art weary and worn --
and fain was their war-broken soldier to stay --
but sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn 
and the voice in my dreaming ear melted away 








i dream'd that as i wander'd by the way
bare winter suddenly was changed to spring 
and gentle odours led my steps astray 
mix'd with a sound of waters murmuring
along a shelving bank of turf which lay
under a copse and hardly dared to fling
its green arms round the bosom of the stream 
but kiss'd it and then fled as thou mightest in dream 

there grew pied wind-flowers and violets 
daisies those pearl'd arcturi of the earth 
the constellated flower that never sets 
faint oxlips tender blue-bells at whose birth
the sod scarce heaved and that tall flower that wets
its mother's face with heaven-collected tears 
when the low wind its playmate's voice it hears 

and in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine 
green cow-bind and the moonlight-colour'd may 
and cherry-blossoms and white cups whose wine
was the bright dew yet drain'd not by the day 
and wild roses and ivy serpentine 
with its dark buds and leaves wandering astray 
and flowers azure black and streak'd with gold 
fairer than any waken'd eyes behold 

and nearer to the rivers trembling edge
there grew broad flag-flowers purple prankt with white 
and starry river-buds among the sedge 
and floating water-lilies broad and bright 
which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
with moonlight beams of their own watery light 
and bulrushes and reeds of such deep green
as soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen 

methought that of these visionary flowers
i made a nosegay bound in such a way
that the same hues which in their natural bowers
were mingled or opposed the like array
kept these imprison'd children of the hours
within my hand --and then elate and gay 
i hasten'd to the spot whence i had come
that i might there present it--o to whom 








most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
to pace the ground if path there be or none 
while a fair region round the traveller lies
which he forbears again to look upon 

pleased rather with some soft ideal scene
the work of fancy or some happy tone
of meditation slipping in between
the beauty coming and the beauty gone 

--if thought and love desert us from that day
let us break off all commerce with the muse 
with thought and love companions of our way--

whate'er the senses take or may refuse --
the mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
of inspiration on the humblest lay 








ever let the fancy roam 
pleasure never is at home 
at a touch sweet pleasure melteth 
like to bubbles when rain pelteth 
then let wing d fancy wander
through the thought still spread beyond her 
open wide the mind's cage-door 
she'll dart forth and cloudward soar 
o sweet fancy let her loose 
summer's joys are spoilt by use 
and the enjoying of the spring
fades as does its blossoming 
autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too
blushing through the mist and dew
cloys with tasting what do then 
sit thee by the ingle when
the sear faggot blazes bright 
spirit of a winter's night 
when the soundless earth is muffled 
and the cak d snow is shuffled
from the ploughboy's heavy shoon 
when the night doth meet the noon
in dark conspiracy
to banish even from her sky 
--sit thee there and send abroad
with a mind self-overawed
fancy high-commission'd --send her 
she has vassals to attend her 
she will bring in spite of frost 
beauties that the earth hath lost 
she will bring thee all together 
all delights of summer weather 
all the buds and bells of may 
from dewy sward or thorny spray 
all the heap d autumn's wealth 
with a still mysterious stealth 
she will mix these pleasures up
like three fit wines in a cup 
and thou shalt quaff it --thou shalt hear
distant harvest-carols clear 
rustle of the reap d corn 
sweet birds antheming the morn 
and in the same moment--hark 
'tis the early april lark 
or the rooks with busy caw 
foraging for sticks and straw 
thou shalt at one glance behold
the daisy and the marigold 
white-plumed lilies and the first
hedge-grown primrose that hath burst 
shaded hyacinth alway
sapphire queen of the mid-may 
and every leaf and every flower
pearl d with the self-same shower 
thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
meagre from its cell d sleep 
and the snake all winter-thin
cast on sunny bank its skin 
freckled nest eggs thou shalt see
hatching in the hawthorn-tree 
when the hen-bird's wing doth rest
quiet on her mossy nest 
then the hurry and alarm
when the bee-hive casts its swarm 
acorns ripe down-pattering
while the autumn breezes sing 

o sweet fancy let her loose 
everything is spoilt by use 
where's the cheek that doth not fade 
too much gazed at where's the maid
whose lip mature is ever new 
where's the eye however blue 
doth not weary where's the face
one would meet in every place 
where's the voice however soft 
one would hear so very oft 
at a touch sweet pleasure melteth
like to bubbles when rain pelteth 
let then wing d fancy find
thee a mistress to thy mind 
dulcet-eyed as ceres' daughter 
ere the god of torment taught her
how to frown and how to chide 
with a waist and with a side
white as hebe's when her zone
slipt its golden clasp and down
fell her kirtle to her feet 
while she held the goblet sweet 
and jove grew languid --break the mesh
of the fancy's silken leash 
quickly break her prison-string 
and such joys as these she'll bring 
--let the wing d fancy roam 
pleasure never is at home 








life of life thy lips enkindle
with their love the breath between them 
and thy smiles before they dwindle
make the cold air fire then screen them
in those locks where whoso gazes
faints entangled in their mazes 

child of light thy limbs are burning
through the veil which seems to hide them 
as the radiant lines of morning
through thin clouds ere they divide them 
and this atmosphere divinest
shrouds thee wheresoe'er thou shinest 

fair are others none beholds thee 
but thy voice sounds low and tender
like the fairest for it folds thee
from the sight that liquid splendour 
and all feel yet see thee never --
as i feel now lost for ever 

lamp of earth where'er thou movest
its dim shapes are clad with brightness 
and the souls of whom thou lovest
walk upon the winds with lightness
till they fail as i am failing 
dizzy lost yet unbewailing 








i heard a thousand blended notes
while in a grove i sat reclined 
in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
bring sad thoughts to the mind 

to her fair works did nature link
the human soul that through me ran 
and much it grieved my heart to think
what man has made of man 

through primrose tufts in that sweet bower 
the periwinkle trail'd its wreaths 
and 'tis my faith that every flower
enjoys the air it breathes 

the birds around me hopp'd and play'd 
their thoughts i cannot measure--
but the least motion which they made
it seem'd a thrill of pleasure 

the budding twigs spread out their fan
to catch the breezy air 
and i must think do all i can 
that there was pleasure there 

if this belief from heaven be sent 
if such be nature's holy plan 
have i not reason to lament
what man has made of man 








when ruth was left half desolate 
her father took another mate 
and ruth not seven years old 
a slighted child at her own will
went wandering over dale and hill 
in thoughtless freedom bold 

and she had made a pipe of straw 
and music from that pipe could draw
like sounds of winds and floods 
had built a bower upon the green 
as if she from her birth had been
an infant of the woods 

beneath her father's roof alone
she seem'd to live her thoughts her own 
herself her own delight 
pleased with herself nor sad nor gay 
she pass'd her time and in this way
grew up to woman's height 

there came a youth from georgia's shore--
a military casque he wore
with splendid feathers drest 
he brought them from the cherokees 
the feathers nodded in the breeze
and made a gallant crest 

from indian blood you deem him sprung 
but no he spake the english tongue
and bore a soldier's name 
and when america was free
from battle and from jeopardy 
he 'cross the ocean came 

with hues of genius on his cheek 
in finest tones the youth could speak 
--while he was yet a boy
the moon the glory of the sun 
and streams that murmur as they run
had been his dearest joy 

he was a lovely youth i guess
the panther in the wilderness
was not so fair as he 
and when he chose to sport and play 
no dolphin ever was so gay
upon the tropic sea 

among the indians he had fought 
and with him many tales he brought
of pleasure and of fear 
such tales as told to any maid
by such a youth in the green shade 
were perilous to hear 

he told of girls a happy rout 
who quit their fold with dance and shout 
their pleasant indian town 
to gather strawberries all day long 
returning with a choral song
when daylight is gone down 

he spake of plants that hourly change
their blossoms through a boundless range
of intermingling hues 
with budding fading faded flowers 
they stand the wonder of the bowers
from morn to evening dews 

he told of the magnolia spread
high as a cloud high over head 
the cypress and her spire 
--of flowers that with one scarlet gleam
cover a hundred leagues and seem
to set the hills on fire 

the youth of green savannahs spake 
and many an endless endless lake 
with all its fairy crowds
of islands that together lie
as quietly as spots of sky
among the evening clouds 

and then he said how sweet it were
a fisher or a hunter there 
in sunshine or in shade
to wander with an easy mind 
and build a household fire and find
a home in every glade 

 what days and what bright years ah me 
our life were life indeed with thee
so pass'd in quiet bliss 
and all the while said he to know
that we were in a world of woe 
on such an earth as this 

and then he sometimes interwove
fond thoughts about a father's love 
 for there said he are spun
around the heart such tender ties 
that our own children to our eyes
are dearer than the sun 

 sweet ruth and could you go with me
my helpmate in the woods to be 
our shed at night to rear 
or run my own adopted bride 
a sylvan huntress at my side 
and drive the flying deer 

 beloved ruth --no more he said 
the wakeful ruth at midnight shed
a solitary tear 
she thought again--and did agree
with him to sail across the sea 
and drive the flying deer 

 and now as fitting is and right 
we in the church our faith will plight 
a husband and a wife 
even so they did and i may say
that to sweet ruth that happy day
was more than human life 

through dream and vision did she sink 
delighted all the while to think
that on those lonesome floods 
and green savannahs she should share
his board with lawful joy and bear
his name in the wild woods 

but as you have before been told 
this stripling sportive gay and bold 
and with his dancing crest
so beautiful through savage lands
had roam'd about with vagrant bands
of indians in the west 

the wind the tempest roaring high 
the tumult of a tropic sky
might well be dangerous food
for him a youth to whom was given
so much of earth--so much of heaven 
and such impetuous blood 

whatever in those climes he found
irregular in sight or sound
did to his mind impart
a kindred impulse seem'd allied
to his own powers and justified
the workings of his heart 

nor less to feed voluptuous thought 
the beauteous forms of nature wrought --
fair trees and gorgeous flowers 
the breezes their own languor lent 
the stars had feelings which they sent
into those favour'd bowers 

yet in his worst pursuits i ween
that sometimes there did intervene
pure hopes of high intent 
for passions link'd to forms so fair
and stately needs must have their share
of noble sentiment 

but ill he lived much evil saw 
with men to whom no better law
nor better life was known 
deliberately and undeceived 
those wild men's vices he received 
and gave them back his own 

his genius and his moral frame
were thus impair'd and he became
the slave of low desires 
a man who without self-control
would seek what the degraded soul
unworthily admires 

and yet he with no feign'd delight
had woo'd the maiden day and night
had loved her night and morn 
what could he less than love a maid
whose heart with so much nature play'd--
so kind and so forlorn 

sometimes most earnestly he said 
 o ruth i have been worse than dead 
false thoughts thoughts bold and vain
encompass'd me on every side
when i in confidence and pride 
had cross'd the atlantic main 

 before me shone a glorious world
fresh as a banner bright unfurl'd
to music suddenly 
i look'd upon those hills and plains 
and seem'd as if let loose from chains
to live at liberty 

 no more of this--for now by thee 
dear ruth more happily set free
with nobler zeal i burn 
my soul from darkness is released
like the whole sky when to the east
the morning doth return 

full soon that better mind was gone 
no hope no wish remain'd not one --
they stirr'd him now no more 
new objects did new pleasure give 
and once again he wish'd to live
as lawless as before 

meanwhile as thus with him it fared 
they for the voyage were prepared 
and went to the sea-shore 
but when they thither came the youth
deserted his poor bride and ruth
could never find him more 

god help thee ruth --such pains she had
that she in half a year was mad
and in a prison housed 
and there exulting in her wrongs 
among the music of her songs
she fearfully caroused 

yet sometimes milder hours she knew 
nor wanted sun nor rain nor dew 
nor pastimes of the may 
--they all were with her in her cell 
and a clear brook with cheerful knell
did o'er the pebbles play 

when ruth three seasons thus had lain 
there came a respite to her pain 
she from her prison fled 
but of the vagrant none took thought 
and where it liked her best she sought
her shelter and her bread 

among the fields she breathed again 
the master-current of her brain
ran permanent and free 
and coming to the banks of tone 
there did she rest and dwell alone
under the greenwood tree 

the engines of her pain the tools
that shaped her sorrow rocks and pools 
and airs that gently stir
the vernal leaves--she loved them still 
nor ever tax'd them with the ill
which had been done to her 

a barn her winter bed supplies 
but till the warmth of summer skies
and summer days is gone 
 and all do in this tale agree 
she sleeps beneath the greenwood tree 
and other home hath none 

an innocent life yet far astray 
and ruth will long before her day 
be broken down and old 
sore aches she needs must have but less
of mind than body's wretchedness 
from damp and rain and cold 

if she is prest by want of food
she from her dwelling in the wood
repairs to a road-side 
and there she begs at one steep place
where up and down with easy pace
the horsemen-travellers ride 

that oaten pipe of hers is mute
or thrown away but with a flute
her loneliness she cheers 
this flute made of a hemlock stalk 
at evening in his homeward walk
the quantock woodman hears 

i too have pass'd her on the hills
setting her little water-mills
by spouts and fountains wild--
such small machinery as she turn'd
ere she had wept ere she had mourn'd 
a young and happy child 

farewell and when thy days are told 
ill-fated ruth in hallow'd mould
thy corpse shall buried be 
for thee a funeral bell shall ring 
and all the congregation sing
a christian psalm for thee 








many a green isle needs must be
in the deep wide sea of misery 
or the mariner worn and wan 
never thus could voyage on
day and night and night and day 
drifting on his dreary way 
with the solid darkness black
closing round his vessel's track 
whilst above the sunless sky
big with clouds hangs heavily 
and behind the tempest fleet
hurries on with lightning feet 
riving sail and cord and plank 
till the ship has almost drank
death from the o'er-brimming deep 
and sinks down down like that sleep
when the dreamer seems to be
weltering through eternity 
and the dim low line before
of a dark and distant shore
still recedes as ever still
longing with divided will 
but no power to seek or shun 
he is ever drifted on
o'er the unreposing wave 
to the haven of the grave 

ah many flowering islands lie
in the waters of wide agony 
to such a one this morn was led
my bark by soft winds piloted 
--'mid the mountains euganean
i stood listening to the paean
with which the legion'd rooks did hail
the sun's uprise majestical 
gathering round with wings all hoar 
through the dewy mist they soar
like gray shades till the eastern heaven
bursts and then --as clouds of even
fleck'd with fire and azure lie
in the unfathomable sky --
so their plumes of purple grain
starr'd with drops of golden rain
gleam above the sunlight woods 
as in silent multitudes
on the morning's fitful gale
through the broken mist they sail 
and the vapours cloven and gleaming
follow down the dark steep streaming 
till all is bright and clear and still
round the solitary hill 

beneath is spread like a green sea
the waveless plain of lombardy 
bounded by the vaporous air 
islanded by cities fair 
underneath day's azure eyes 
ocean's nursling venice lies --
a peopled labyrinth of walls 
amphitrite's destined halls 
which her hoary sire now paves
with his blue and beaming waves 
lo the sun upsprings behind 
broad red radiant half-reclined
on the level quivering line
of the waters crystalline 
and before that chasm of light 
as within a furnace bright 
column tower and dome and spire 
shine like obelisks of fire 
pointing with inconstant motion
from the altar of dark ocean
to the sapphire-tinted skies 
as the flames of sacrifice
from the marble shrines did rise
as to pierce the dome of gold
where apollo spoke of old 

sun-girt city thou hast been
ocean's child and then his queen 
now is come a darker day 
and thou soon must be his prey 
if the power that raised thee here
hallow so thy watery bier 
a less drear ruin then than now
with thy conquest-branded brow
stooping to the slave of slaves
from thy throne among the waves 
wilt thou be --when the sea-mew
flies as once before it flew 
o'er thine isles depopulate 
and all is in its ancient state 
save where many a palace-gate
with green sea-flowers overgrown
like a rock of ocean's own 
topples o'er the abandon'd sea
as the tides change sullenly 
the fisher on his watery way
wandering at the close of day 
will spread his sail and seize his oar
till he pass the gloomy shore 
lest thy dead should from their sleep
bursting o'er the starlight deep 
lead a rapid masque of death
o'er the waters of his path 

noon descends around me now 
'tis the noon of autumn's glow 
when a soft and purple mist
like a vaporous amethyst 
or an air-dissolv d star
mingling light and fragrance far
from the curved horizon's bound
to the point of heaven's profound 
fills the overflowing sky 
and the plains that silent lie
underneath the leaves unsodden
where the infant frost has trodden
with his morning-wing d feet
whose bright print is gleaming yet 
and the red and golden vines
piercing with their trellised lines
the rough dark-skirted wilderness 
the dun and bladed grass no less 
pointing from this hoary tower
in the windless air the flower
glimmering at my feet the line
of the olive-sandall'd apennine
in the south dimly islanded 
and the alps whose snows are spread
high between the clouds and sun 
and of living things each one 
and my spirit which so long
darken'd this swift stream of song --
interpenetrated lie
by the glory of the sky 
be it love light harmony 
odour or the soul of all
which from heaven like dew doth fall 
or the mind which feeds this verse
peopling the lone universe 

noon descends and after noon
autumn's evening meets me soon 
leading the infantine moon
and that one star which to her
almost seems to minister
half the crimson light she brings
from the sunset's radiant springs 
and the soft dreams of the morn
 which like wing d winds had borne
to that silent isle which lies
'mid remember'd agonies 
the frail bark of this lone being 
pass to other sufferers fleeing 
and its ancient pilot pain 
sits beside the helm again 

other flowering isles must be
in the sea of life and agony 
other spirits float and flee
o'er that gulf ev'n now perhaps 
on some rock the wild wave wraps 
with folding wings they waiting sit
for my bark to pilot it
to some calm and blooming cove 
where for me and those i love 
may a windless bower be built 
far from passion pain and guilt 
in a dell 'mid lawny hills
which the wild sea-murmur fills 
and soft sunshine and the sound
of old forests echoing round 
and the light and smell divine
of all flowers that breathe and shine 
--we may live so happy there 
that the spirits of the air 
envying us may even entice
to our healing paradise
the polluting multitude 
but their rage would be subdued
by that clime divine and calm 
and the winds whose wings rain balm
on the uplifted soul and leaves
under which the bright sea heaves 
while each breathless interval
in their whisperings musical
the inspired soul supplies
with its own deep melodies 
and the love which heals all strife
circling like the breath of life 
all things in that sweet abode
with its own mild brotherhood 
they not it would change and soon
every sprite beneath the moon
would repent its envy vain 
and the earth grow young again 








o wild west wind thou breath of autumn's being 
thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing 
yellow and black and pale and hectic red 
pestilence-stricken multitudes o thou
who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
the wing d seeds where they lie cold and low 
each like a corpse within its grave until
thine azure sister of the spring shall blow
her clarion o'er the dreaming earth and fill
 driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air 
with living hues and odours plain and hill 
wild spirit which art moving everywhere 
destroyer and preserver hear o hear 

thou on whose stream 'mid the steep sky's commotion 
loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed
shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean 
angels of rain and lightning there are spread
on the blue surface of thine airy surge 
like the bright hair uplifted from the head
of some fierce maenad ev'n from the dim verge
of the horizon to the zenith's height--
the locks of the approaching storm thou dirge
of the dying year to which this closing night
will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 
vaulted with all thy congregated might
of vapours from whose solid atmosphere
black rain and fire and hail will burst o hear 

thou who didst waken from his summer-dreams
the blue mediterranean where he lay
lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams 
beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay 
and saw in sleep old palaces and towers
quivering within the wave's intenser day 
all overgrown with azure moss and flowers
so sweet the sense faints picturing them thou
for whose path the atlantic's level powers
cleave themselves into chasms while far below
the sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
the sapless foliage of the ocean know
thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear
and tremble and despoil themselves o hear 

if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear 
if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee 
a wave to pant beneath thy power and share
the impulse of thy strength only less free
than thou o uncontrollable if even
i were as in my boyhood and could be
the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven 
as then when to outstrip the skyey speed
scarce seem'd a vision i would ne'er have striven
as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need 
o lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud 
i fall upon the thorns of life i bleed 
a heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd
one too like thee tameless and swift and proud 

make me thy lyre ev'n as the forest is 
what if my leaves are falling like its own 
the tumult of thy mighty harmonies
will take from both a deep autumnal tone 
sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce 
my spirit be thou me impetuous one 
drive my dead thoughts over the universe
like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth 
and by the incantation of this verse 
scatter as from an unextinguish'd hearth
ashes and sparks my words among mankind 
be through my lips to unawaken'd earth
the trumpet of a prophecy o wind 
if winter comes can spring be far behind 








 suggested by a picture of peele castle in a storm painted by
sir george beaumont 

i was thy neighbour once thou rugged pile 
four summer weeks i dwelt in sight of thee 
i saw thee every day and all the while
thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea 

so pure the sky so quiet was the air 
so like so very like was day to day 
whene'er i look'd thy image still was there 
it trembled but it never pass'd away 

how perfect was the calm it seem'd no sleep 
no mood which season takes away or brings 
i could have fancied that the mighty deep
was even the gentlest of all gentle things 

ah then if mine had been the painter's hand
to express what then i saw and add the gleam 
the light that never was on sea or land 
the consecration and the poet's dream --

i would have planted thee thou hoary pile 
amid a world how different from this 
beside a sea that could not cease to smile 
on tranquil land beneath a sky of bliss 

a picture had it been of lasting ease 
elysian quiet without toil or strife 
no motion but the moving tide a breeze 
or merely silent nature's breathing life 

such in the fond illusion of my heart 
such picture would i at that time have made 
and seen the soul of truth in every part 
a steadfast peace that might not be betray'd 

so once it would have been --'tis so no more
i have submitted to a new control 
a power is gone which nothing can restore 
a deep distress hath humanised my soul 

not for a moment could i now behold
a smiling sea and be what i have been 
the feeling of my loss will ne'er be old 
this which i know i speak with mind serene 

then beaumont friend who would have been the friend
if he had lived of him whom i deplore 
this work of thine i blame not but commend 
this sea in anger and that dismal shore 

o 'tis a passionate work --yet wise and well 
well chosen is the spirit that is here 
that hulk which labours in the deadly swell 
this rueful sky this pageantry of fear 

and this huge castle standing here sublime 
i love to see the look with which it braves 
--cased in the unfeeling armour of old time--
the lightning the fierce wind and trampling waves 

farewell farewell the heart that lives alone 
housed in a dream at distance from the kind 
such happiness wherever it be known 
is to be pitied for 'tis surely blind 

but welcome fortitude and patient cheer 
and frequent sights of what is to be borne 
such sights or worse as are before me here 
not without hope we suffer and we mourn 








on a poet's lips i slept
dreaming like a love-adept
in the sound his breathing kept 
nor seeks nor finds he mortal blisses 
but feeds on the aerial kisses
of shapes that haunt thought's wildernesses 
he will watch from dawn to gloom
the lake-reflected sun illume
the yellow bees in the ivy-bloom 
nor heed nor see what things they be--
but from these create he can
forms more real than living man 
nurslings of immortality 








the world is too much with us late and soon 
getting and spending we lay waste our powers 
little we see in nature that is ours 
we have given our hearts away a sordid boon 

this sea that bares her bosom to the moon 
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up-gather'd now like sleeping flowers 
for this for everything we are out of tune 

it moves us not --great god i'd rather be
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn --
so might i standing on this pleasant lea 

have glimpses that would make me less forlorn 
have sight of proteus rising from the sea 
or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn 








tax not the royal saint with vain expense 
with ill-match'd aims the architect who plann'd
 albeit labouring for a scanty band
of white-robed scholars only this immense

and glorious work of fine intelligence 
--give all thou canst high heaven rejects the lore
of nicely-calculated less or more --
so deem'd the man who fashion'd for the sense

these lofty pillars spread that branching roof
self-poised and scoop'd into ten thousand cells
where light and shade repose where music dwells

lingering and wandering on as loth to die--
like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
that they were born for immortality 








verse a breeze 'mid blossoms straying 
where hope clung feeding like a bee--
both were mine life went a-maying
with nature hope and poesy 
when i was young 

when i was young --ah woeful when 
ah for the change 'twixt now and then 
this breathing house not built with hands 
this body that does me grievous wrong 
o'er aery cliffs and glittering sands
how lightly then it flash'd along 
like those trim skiffs unknown of yore 
on winding lakes and rivers wide 
that ask no aid of sail or oar 
that fear no spite of wind or tide 
nought cared this body for wind or weather
when youth and i lived in't together 
flowers are lovely love is flower-like 
friendship is a sheltering tree 
o the joys that came down shower-like 
of friendship love and liberty 
ere i was old 

ere i was old ah woeful ere 
which tells me youth's no longer here 
o youth for years so many and sweet
'tis known that thou and i were one 
i'll think it but a fond conceit--
it cannot be that thou art gone 
thy vesper-bell hath not yet toll'd --
and thou wert aye a masker bold 
what strange disguise hast now put on
to make believe that thou art gone 
i see these locks in silvery slips 
this drooping gait this alter'd size 
but springtide blossoms on thy lips 
and tears take sunshine from thine eyes 
life is but thought so think i will
that youth and i are housemates still 

dew-drops are the gems of morning 
but the tears of mournful eve 
where no hope is life's a warning
that only serves to make us grieve

when we are old 
--that only serves to make us grieve
with oft and tedious taking-leave 
like some poor nigh-related guest
that may not rudely be dismist 
yet hath out-stay'd his welcome while 
and tells the jest without a smile 








we walk'd along while bright and red
uprose the morning sun 
and matthew stopp'd he looked and said 
 the will of god be done 

a village schoolmaster was he 
with hair of glittering gray 
as blithe a man as you could see
on a spring holiday 

and on that morning through the grass 
and by the steaming rills
we travel'd merrily to pass
a day among the hills 

 our work said i was well begun 
then from thy breast what thought 
beneath so beautiful a sun 
so sad a sigh has brought 

a second time did matthew stop 
and fixing still his eye
upon the eastern mountain-top 
to me he made reply 

 yon cloud with that long purple cleft
brings fresh into my mind
a day like this which i have left
full thirty years behind 

 and just above yon slope of corn
such colours and no other 
were in the sky that april morn
of this the very brother 

 with rod and line i sued the sport
which that sweet season gave 
and to the church-yard come stopp'd short
beside my daughter's grave 

 nine summers had she scarcely seen 
the pride of all the vale 
and then she sang --she would have been
a very nightingale 

 six feet in earth my emma lay 
and yet i loved her more--
for so it seem'd --than till that day
i e'er had loved before 

 and turning from her grave i met 
beside the church-yard yew 
a blooming girl whose hair was wet
with points of morning dew 

 a basket on her head she bare 
her brow was smooth and white 
to see a child so very fair 
it was a pure delight 

 no fountain from its rocky cave
e'er tripped with foot so free 
she seem'd as happy as a wave
that dances on the sea 

 there came from me a sigh of pain
which i could ill confine 
i looked at her and looked again
and did not wish her mine 

--matthew is in his grave yet now 
methinks i see him stand
as at that moment with a bough
of wilding in his hand 








 a conversation 

we talk'd with open heart and tongue
affectionate and true 
a pair of friends though i was young 
and matthew seventy-two 

we lay beneath a spreading oak 
beside a mossy seat 
and from the turf a fountain broke
and gurgled at our feet 

 now matthew said i let us match
this water's pleasant tune
with some old border song or catch
that suits a summer's noon 

 or of the church-clock and the chimes
sing here beneath the shade
that half-mad thing of witty rhymes
which you last april made 

in silence matthew lay and eyed
the spring beneath the tree 
and thus the dear old man replied 
the gray-hair'd man of glee 

 no check no stay this streamlet fears 
how merrily it goes 
'twill murmur on a thousand years
and flow as now it flows 

 and here on this delightful day
i cannot choose but think
how oft a vigorous man i lay
beside this fountain's brink 

 my eyes are dim with childish tears 
my heart is idly stirr'd 
for the same sound is in my ears
which in those days i heard 

 thus fares it still in our decay 
and yet the wiser mind
mourns less for what age takes away 
than what it leaves behind 

 the blackbird amid leafy trees--
the lark above the hill 
let loose their carols when they please 
are quiet when they will 

 with nature never do they wage
a foolish strife they see
a happy youth and their old age
is beautiful and free 

 but we are press'd by heavy laws 
and often glad no more 
we wear a face of joy because
we have been glad of yore 

 if there be one who need bemoan
his kindred laid in earth 
the household hearts that were his own --
it is the man of mirth 

 my days my friend are almost gone 
my life has been approved 
and many love me but by none
am i enough beloved 

 now both himself and me he wrongs 
the man who thus complains 
i live and sing my idle songs
upon these happy plains 

 and matthew for thy children dead
i'll be a son to thee 
at this he grasp'd my hand and said 
 alas that cannot be 

we rose up from the fountain-side 
and down the smooth descent
of the green sheep-track did we glide
and through the wood we went 

and ere we came to leonard's rock 
he sang those witty rhymes
about the crazy old church-clock 
and the bewilder'd chimes 








the more we live more brief appear
our life's succeeding stages 
a day to childhood seems a year 
and years like passing ages 

the gladsome current of our youth
ere passion yet disorders 
steals lingering like a river smooth
along its grassy borders 

but as the careworn cheek grows wan 
and sorrow's shafts fly thicker 
ye stars that measure life to man 
why seem your courses quicker 

when joys have lost their bloom and breath
and life itself is vapid 
why as we reach the falls of death 
feel we its tide more rapid 

it may be strange--yet who would change
time's course to lower speeding 
when one by one our friends have gone
and left our bosoms bleeding 

heaven gives our years of fading strength
indemnifying fleetness 
and those of youth a seeming length 
proportion'd to their sweetness 








four seasons fill the measure of the year 
there are four seasons in the mind of man 
he has his lusty spring when fancy clear
takes in all beauty with an easy span 

he has his summer when luxuriously
spring's honey'd cud of youthful thought he loves
to ruminate and by such dreaming high
is nearest unto heaven quiet coves

his soul has in its autumn when his wings
he furleth close contented so to look
on mists in idleness--to let fair things
pass by unheeded as a threshold brook --

he has his winter too of pale misfeature 
or else he would forego his mortal nature 








o world o life o time 
on whose last steps i climb 
trembling at that where i had stood before 
when will return the glory of your prime 
no more--o never more 

out of the day and night
a joy has taken flight 
fresh spring and summer and winter hoar
move my faint heart with grief but with delight
no more--o never more 








my heart leaps up when i behold
a rainbow in the sky 
so was it when my life began 
so is it now i am a man 
so be it when i shall grow old
or let me die 
the child is father of the man 
i could wish my days to be
bound each to each by natural piety 









there was a time when meadow grove and stream 
the earth and every common sight
to me did seem
apparell'd in celestial light 
the glory and the freshness of a dream 
it is not now as it hath been of yore --
turn wheresoe'er i may 
by night or day 
the things which i have seen i now can see no more 

the rainbow comes and goes 
and lovely is the rose 
the moon doth with delight
look round her when the heavens are bare 
waters on a starry night
are beautiful and fair 
the sunshine is a glorious birth 
but yet i know where'er i go 
that there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth 

now while the birds thus sing a joyous song 
and while the young lambs bound
as to the tabor's sound 
to me alone there came a thought of grief 
a timely utterance gave that thought relief 
and i again am strong 
the cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep --
no more shall grief of mine the season wrong 
i hear the echoes through the mountains throng 
the winds come to me from the fields of sleep 
and all the earth is gay 
land and sea
give themselves up to jollity 
and with the heart of may
doth every beast keep holiday --
thou child of joy 
shout round me let me hear thy shouts thou happy
shepherd boy 

ye bless d creatures i have heard the call
ye to each other make i see
the heavens laugh with you in your jubilee 
my heart is at your festival 
my head hath its coronal 
the fulness of your bliss i feel--i feel it all 
o evil day if i were sullen
while earth herself is adorning
this sweet may morning 
and the children are pulling
on every side
in a thousand valleys far and wide
fresh flowers while the sun shines warm 
and the babe leaps up on his mother's arm --
i hear i hear with joy i hear 
--but there's a tree of many one 
a single field which i have look'd upon 
both of them speak of something that is gone 
the pansy at my feet
doth the same tale repeat 
whither is fled the visionary gleam 
where is it now the glory and the dream 

our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting 
the soul that rises with us our life's star 
hath had elsewhere its setting
and cometh from afar 
not in entire forgetfulness
and not in utter nakedness
but trailing clouds of glory do we come
from god who is our home 
heaven lies about us in our infancy 
shades of the prison-house begin to close
upon the growing boy 
but he beholds the light and whence it flows 
he sees it in his joy 
the youth who daily farther from the east
must travel still is nature's priest 
and by the vision splendid
is on his way attended 
at length the man perceives it die away 
and fade into the light of common day 

earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own 
yearnings she hath in her own natural kind 
and even with something of a mother's mind 
and no unworthy aim 
the homely nurse doth all she can
to make her foster-child her inmate man 
forget the glories he hath known
and that imperial palace whence he came 

behold the child among his new-born blisses 
a six years' darling of a pigmy size 
see where 'mid work of his own hand he lies 
fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses 
with light upon him from his father's eyes 
see at his feet some little plan or chart 
some fragment from his dream of human life 
shaped by himself with newly-learn d art 
a wedding or a festival 
a mourning or a funeral 
and this hath now his heart 
and unto this he frames his song 
then will he fit his tongue
to dialogues of business love or strife 
but it will not be long
ere this be thrown aside 
and with new joy and pride
the little actor cons another part 
filling from time to time his humorous stage 
with all the persons down to palsied age 
that life brings with her in her equipage 
as if his whole vocation
were endless imitation 

thou whose exterior semblance doth belie
thy soul's immensity 
thou best philosopher who yet dost keep
thy heritage thou eye among the blind 
that deaf and silent read'st the eternal deep 
haunted for ever by the eternal mind --
mighty prophet seer blest 
on whom those truths do rest
which we are toiling all our lives to find 
in darkness lost the darkness of the grave 
thou over whom thy immortality
broods like the day a master o'er a slave 
a presence which is not to be put by 
thou little child yet glorious in the might
of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height 
why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
the years to bring the inevitable yoke 
thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife 
full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight 
and custom lie upon thee with a weight
heavy as frost and deep almost as life 

o joy that in our embers
is something that doth live 
that nature yet remembers
what was so fugitive 
the thought of our past years in me doth breed
perpetual benediction not indeed
for that which is most worthy to be blest 
delight and liberty the simple creed
of childhood whether busy or at rest 
with new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast 
--not for these i raise
the song of thanks and praise 
but for those obstinate questionings
of sense and outward things 
fallings from us vanishings 
blank misgivings of a creature
moving about in worlds not realised 
high instincts before which our mortal nature
did tremble like a guilty thing surprised 
but for those first affections 
those shadowy recollections 
which be they what they may 
are yet the fountain-light of all our day 
are yet a master-light of all our seeing 
uphold us--cherish--and have power to make
our noisy years seem moments in the being
of the eternal silence truths that wake 
to perish never 
which neither listlessness nor mad endeavour
nor man nor boy
nor all that is at enmity with joy 
can utterly abolish or destroy 
hence in a season of calm weather
though inland far we be 
our souls have sight of that immortal sea
which brought us hither 
can in a moment travel thither--
and see the children sport upon the shore 
and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore 

then sing ye birds sing sing a joyous song 
and let the young lambs bound
as to the tabor's sound 
we in thought will join your throng
ye that pipe and ye that play 
ye that through your hearts to-day
feel the gladness of the may 
what though the radiance which was once so bright
be now for ever taken from my sight 
though nothing can bring back the hour
of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower 
we will grieve not rather find
strength in what remains behind 
in the primal sympathy
which having been must ever be 
in the soothing thoughts that spring
out of human suffering 
in the faith that looks through death 
in years that bring the philosophic mind 

and o ye fountains meadows hills and groves 
forebode not any severing of our loves 
yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might 
i only have relinquish'd one delight
to live beneath your more habitual sway 
i love the brooks which down their channels fret
even more than when i tripp'd lightly as they 
the innocent brightness of a new-born day
is lovely yet 
the clouds that gather round the setting sun
do take a sober colouring from an eye
that hath kept watch o'er man's mortality 
another race hath been and other palms are won 
thanks to the human heart by which we live 
thanks to its tenderness its joys and fears 
to me the meanest flower that blows can give
thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears 








music when soft voices die 
vibrates in the memory--
odours when sweet violets sicken 
live within the sense they quicken 

rose leaves when the rose is dead 
are heap'd for the beloved's bed 
and so thy thoughts when thou art gone 
love itself shall slumber on 










poem 
 rouse memnon's mother awaken the dawn from the dark earth and the
clouds where she is resting aurora in the old mythology is mother of
memnon the east and wife of tithonus the appearances of earth and
sky during the last hours of night she leaves him every morning in
renewed youth to prepare the way for phoebus the sun whilst tithonus
remains in perpetual old age and grayness 

 by peneus' streams phoebus loved the nymph daphne whom he met by the
river peneus in the vale of tempe this legend expressed the attachment
of the laurel daphne to the sun under whose heat the tree both fades
and flourishes it has been thought worth while to explain these
allusions because they illustrate the character of the grecian
mythology which arose in the personification of natural phenomena and
was totally free from those debasing and ludicrous ideas with which 
through roman and later misunderstanding or perversion it has been
associated 

 amphion's lyre he was said to have built the walls of thebes to the
sound of his music

a fine example of the high-wrought and conventional elizabethan

poem 
this poem with and is taken from davison's rhapsody first
published in one stanza has been here omitted in accordance with
the principle noticed in the preface similar omissions occur in 
 the more serious abbreviation by which it
has been attempted to bring crashaw's wishes and shelley's euganean
hills within the limits of lyrical unity is commended with much
diffidence to the judgment of readers acquainted with the original
pieces 

 presence in line is here conjecturally printed for present a
very few similar corrections of it is presumed misprints have been
made --as thy for my line men for me line viol 
for idol line and one for our line locks for

three more less important

this charming little poem truly old and plain and dallying with the
innocence of love like that spoken of in twelfth night is taken with

poem 

readers who have visited italy will be reminded of more than one picture
by this gorgeous vision of beauty equally sublime and pure in its
paradisaical naturalness lodge wrote it on a voyage to the islands of
terceras and the canaries and he seems to have caught in those
southern seas no small portion of the qualities which marked the almost
contemporary art of venice --the glory and the glow of veronese or
titian or tintoret when he most resembles titian and all but
surpasses him 

 the clear is the crystalline or outermost heaven of the old
cosmography for resembling other copies give refining the correct
reading is perhaps revealing

wordsworth thinking probably of the venus and the lucrece said
finely of shakespeare shakespeare could not have written an epic he
would have died of plethora of thought this prodigality of nature is
exemplified equally in his sonnets the copious selection here given
 which from the wealth of the material required greater consideration
than any other portion of the editor's task contains many that will not
be fully felt and understood without some earnestness of thought on the
reader's part but he is not likely to regret the labour

 osiris the egyptian god of agriculture here perhaps by confusion
with apis figured as a bull was torn to pieces by typho and embalmed
after death in a sacred chest this myth reproduced in syria and greece
in the legends of thammuz adonis and perhaps absyrtus represents the
annual death of the sun or the year under the influences of the winter
darkness horus the son of osiris as the new year in his turn
overcomes typho --it suited the genius of milton's time to regard this
primaeval poetry and philosophy of the seasons which has a further
reference to the contest of good and evil in creation as a malignant
idolatry shelley's chorus in hellas worlds on worlds treats the
subject in a larger and sweeter spirit 

 unshower'd grass as watered by the nile only 


poem 

 the late massacre the vaudois persecution carried on in by the
duke of savoy this collect in verse as it has been justly named is
the most mighty sonnet in any language known to the editor readers
should observe that unlike our sonnets of the sixteenth century it is
constructed on the original italian or proven al model --unquestionably
far superior to the imperfect form employed by shakespeare and drummond 


poem 

cromwell returned from ireland in hence the prophecies not
strictly fulfilled of his deference to the parliament in stanzas


this ode beyond doubt one of the finest in our language and more in
milton's style than has been reached by any other poet is occasionally
obscure from imitation of the condensed latin syntax the meaning of st 
 is rivalry or hostility are the same to a lofty spirit and
limitation more hateful than opposition the allusion in st is to
the old physical doctrines of the non-existence of a vacuum and the
impenetrability of matter --in st to the omen traditionally
connected with the foundation of the capitol at rome the ancient belief
that certain years in life complete natural periods and are hence
peculiarly exposed to death is introduced in stanza by the word
 climacteric 


poem 

 lycidas the person lamented is milton's college friend edward king 
drowned in whilst crossing from chester to ireland 

strict pastoral poetry was first written or perfected by the dorian
greeks settled in sicily but the conventional use of it exhibited more
magnificently in lycidas than in any other pastoral is apparently of
roman origin milton employing the noble freedom of a great artist has
here united ancient mythology with what may be called the modern
mythology of camus and saint peter --to direct christian images --the
metrical structure of this glorious poem is partly derived from italian
models 

 sisters of the sacred well the muses said to frequent the fountain
helicon on mount parnassus 

 mona anglesea called by the welsh inis dowil or the dark island 
from its dense forests 

 deva the dee a river which probably derived its magical character
from celtic traditions it was long the boundary of briton and
saxon --these places are introduced as being near the scene of the
shipwreck 

 orpheus was torn to pieces by thracian women amaryllis and neaera 
names used here for the love idols of poets as damoetas previously
for a shepherd 

 the blind fury atropos fabled to cut the thread of life 

 arethuse and mincius sicilian and italian waters here alluded to as
synonymous with the pastoral poetry of theocritus and virgil 

 oat pipe used here like collins' oaten stop no for song 

 hippotades aeolus god of the winds panope a nereid the names of
local deities in the hellenic mythology express generally some feature
in the natural landscape which the greeks studied and analysed with
their usual unequalled insight and feeling panope represents the
boundlessness of the ocean-horizon when seen from a height as compared
with a limited horizon of the land in hilly countries such as greece or
asia minor 

 camus the cam put for king's university 

 the sanguine flower the hyacinth of the ancients probably our iris

 swart star the dogstar called swarthy because its heliacal rising in

 bellerus a giant apparently created here by milton to personify
bellerium the ancient title of the land's end 

 the great vision --the story was that the archangel michael had
appeared on the rock by marazion in mount's bay which bears his name 
milton calls on him to turn his eyes from the south homeward and to
pity lycidas if his body has drifted into the troubled waters of the
land's end finisterre being the land due south of marazion two places
in that district then by our trade with corunna probably less
unfamiliar to english ears are named -- namancos now mujio in
galicia bayona north of the minho or perhaps a fortified rock one
of the cies islands not unlike st michael's mount at the entrance
of vigo bay

 emathian conqueror when thebes was destroyed b c and the

poetry 

 the repeated air of sad electra's poet amongst plutarch's vague
stories he says that when the spartan confederacy in b c took
athens a proposal to demolish it was rejected through the effect
produced on the commanders by hearing part of a chorus from the electra

between the lines quoted ed dindorf and the result ascribed to
them

compliment 


poem 

lady m ley was daughter to sir j ley afterwards earl of marlborough

poem 

the remark quoted in the note to no applies equally to these truly
wonderful verses which like lycidas may be regarded as a test of
any reader's insight into the most poetical aspects of poetry the
general differences between them are vast but in imaginative intensity
marvell and shelley are closely related this poem is printed as a
translation in marvell's works but the original latin is obviously his
own the most striking verses in it here quoted as the book is rare 
answer more or less to stanzas and 

alma quies teneo te et te germana quietis simplicitas vos ergo diu
per templa per urbes quaesivi regum perque alta palatia frustra sed
vos hortorum per opaca silentia longe celarunt plantae virides et

poems 

 l'allegro and il penseroso it is a striking proof of milton's
astonishing power that these the earliest pure descriptive lyrics in
our language should still remain the best in a style which so many
great poets have since attempted the bright and the thoughtful aspects
of nature are their subjects but each is preceded by a mythological
introduction in a mixed classical and italian manner the meaning of the
first is that gaiety is the child of nature of the second that
pensiveness is the daughter of sorrow and genius 

 perverse ingenuity has conjectured that for cerberus we should
read erebus who in the mythology is brother at once and husband of
night but the issue of this union is not sadness but day and
aether --completing the circle of primary creation as the parents are

any other language one verse interpolated by beattie is here
omitted --it contains two good lines but is quite out of harmony with
the original poem

poem 

the editor knows no sonnet more remarkable than this which with 
records cowper's gratitude to the lady whose affectionate care for many
years gave what sweetness he could enjoy to a life radically wretched 
petrarch's sonnets have a more ethereal grace and a more perfect finish 
shakespeare's more passion milton's stand supreme in stateliness 
wordsworth's in depth and delicacy but cowper's unites with an
exquisiteness in the turn of thought which the ancients would have
called irony an intensity of pathetic tenderness peculiar to his loving
and ingenuous nature there is much mannerism much that is unimportant
or of now exhausted interest in his poems but where he is great it is
with that elementary greatness which rests on the most universal human
feelings cowper is our highest master in simple pathos 


poem 

 fancied green cherished garden 


poem 

nothing except his surname appears recoverable with regard to the author
of this truly noble poem it should be noted as exhibiting a rare
excellence --the climax of simple sublimity 

it is a lesson of high instructiveness to examine the essential
qualities which give first-rate poetical rank to lyrics such as
 to-morrow or sally in our alley when compared with poems written
 if the phrase may be allowed in keys so different as the subtle
sweetness of shelley the grandeur of gray and milton or the delightful
pastoralism of the elizabethan verse intelligent readers will gain
hence a clear understanding of the vast imaginative range of
poetry --through what wide oscillations the mind and the taste of a
nation may pass --how many are the roads which truth and nature open to
excellence 


poem 

 stout cortez history requires here balb a a t it may be noticed 
that to find in chapman's homer the pure serene of the original the
reader must bring with him the imagination of the youthful poet --he
must be a greek himself as shelley finely said of keats 


poem 

the most tender and true of byron's smaller poems 


poem 

this poem with exemplifies the peculiar skill with which scott
employs proper names nor is there a surer sign of high poetical genius 


poem 

the editor in this and in other instances has risked the addition or
the change of a title that the aim of the verses following may be
grasped more clearly and immediately 


poem 

 nature's eremite refers to the fable of the wandering jew --this
beautiful sonnet was the last word of a poet deserving the title
 marvellous boy in a much higher sense than chatterton if the
fulfilment may ever safely be prophesied from the promise england
appears to have lost in keats one whose gifts in poetry have rarely been
surpassed shakespeare milton and wordsworth had their lives been
closed at twenty-five would so far as we know have left poems of less
excellence and hope than the youth who from the petty school and the
london surgery passed at once to a place with them of high collateral
glory 


poem 

it is impossible not to regret that moore has written so little in this
sweet and genuinely national style 


poem 

a masterly example of byron's command of strong thought and close
reasoning in verse --as the next is equally characteristic of shelley's
wayward intensity and of the dramatic power the vital
identification of the poet with other times and characters in which
scott is second only to shakespeare 


poem 

bonnivard a genevese was imprisoned by the duke of savoy in chillon on
the lake of geneva for his courageous defence of his country against the
tyranny with which piedmont threatened it during the first half of the
seventeenth century this noble sonnet is worthy to stand near milton's
on the vaudois massacre 


poem 

switzerland was usurped by the french under napoleon in venice in



poem 

this battle was fought dec between the austrians under
archduke john and the french under moreau in a forest near munich 
 hohen linden means high limetrees 


poem 

after the capture of madrid by napoleon sir j moore retreated before
soult and ney to corunna and was killed whilst covering the embarcation
of his troops his tomb built by ney bears this inscription-- john
moore leader of the english armies slain in battle 


poem 

the mermaid was the club-house of shakespeare ben jonson and other
choice spirits of that age 


poem 

 maisie mary scott has given us nothing more complete and lovely than
this little song which unites simplicity and dramatic power to a
wild-wood music of the rarest quality no moral is drawn far less any
conscious analysis of feeling attempted --the pathetic meaning is left
to be suggested by the mere presentiment of the situation inexperienced
critics have often named this which may be called the homeric manner 
superficial from its apparent simple facility but first-rate
excellence in it as shown here in and is in truth one
of the least common triumphs of poetry --this style should be compared
with what is not less perfect in its way the searching out of inner
feeling the expression of hidden meanings the revelation of the heart
of nature and of the soul within the soul --the analytical method in
short --most completely represented by wordsworth and by shelley 


poem 

 correi covert on a hillside cumber trouble 


poem 

two intermediate stanzas have been here omitted they are very
ingenious but of all poetical qualities ingenuity is least in
accordance with pathos 


poem 

this poem has an exaltation and a glory joined with an exquisiteness of
expression which place it in the highest rank amongst the many
masterpieces of its illustrious author 


poem 

 interlunar swoon interval of the moon's invisibility 


poem 

 calpe gibraltar lofoden the maelstrom whirlpool off the n -w 
coast of norway 


poem 

this lovely poem refers here and there to a ballad by hamilton on the
subject better treated in and 


poem 

 arcturi seemingly used for northern stars 

 and wild roses etc our language has no line modulated with more
subtle sweetness a good poet might have written and roses
wild --yet this slight change would disenchant the verse of its peculiar
beauty 


poem 

 ceres' daughter proserpine god of torment pluto 


poem 

this impassioned address expresses shelley's most rapt imaginations and
is the direct modern representative of the feeling which led the greeks
to the worship of nature 


poem 

the leading idea of this beautiful description of a day's landscape in
italy is expressed with an obscurity not unfrequent with its author it
appears to be --on the voyage of life are many moments of pleasure 
given by the sight of nature who has power to heal even the worldliness
and the uncharity of man 

 amphitrite was daughter to ocean 

 sun-girt city it is difficult not to believe that the correct reading
is seagirt many of shelley's poems appear to have been printed in
england during his residence abroad others were printed from his
manuscripts after his death hence probably the text of no english poet
after contains so many errors see the note on no 


poem 

 maenad a frenzied nymph attendant on dionysus in the greek
mythology 

 the sea-blooms etc plants under water sympathise with the seasons
of the laud and hence with the winds which affect them 


poem 

written soon after the death by shipwreck of wordsworth's brother
john this poem should be compared with shelley's following it each is
the most complete expression of the innermost spirit of his art given by
these great poets --of that idea which as in the case of the true
painter to quote the words of reynolds subsists only in the mind 
the sight never beheld it nor has the hand expressed it it is an idea
residing in the breast of the artist which he is always labouring to
impart and which he dies at last without imparting

absence hear thou my protestation
a chieftain to the highlands bound
a flock of sheep that leisurely pass by
ah chloris could i now but sit
ah county guy the hour is nigh
all in the downs the fleet was moor'd
all thoughts all passions all delights
and are ye sure the news is true 
and is this yarrow --this the stream
and thou art dead as young and fair
and wilt thou leave me thus 
ariel to miranda --take
art thou pale for weariness
art thou poor yet hast thou golden slumbers 
as it fell upon a day
as i was walking all alane
a slumber did my spirit seal
as slow our ship her foamy track
a sweet disorder in the dress
at the corner of wood street when daylight appears
at the mid hour of night when stars are weeping i fly
avenge o lord thy slaughter'd saints whose bones
awake aeolian lyre awake
awake awake my lyre 
a weary lot is thine fair maid
a wet sheet and a flowing sea
a widow bird sate mourning for her love


bards of passion and of mirth
beauty sat bathing by a spring
behold her single in the field
being your slave what should i do but tend
beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
best and brightest come away
bid me to live and i will live
blest pair of sirens pledges of heaven's joy
blow blow thou winter wind
bright star would i were steadfast as thou art


call for the robin-redbreast and the wren
calm was the day and through the trembling air
captain or colonel or knight in arms
care-charmer sleep son of the sable night
come away come away death
come live with me and be my love
crabbed age and youth
cupid and my campaspe play'd
cyriack whose grandsire on the royal bench


daughter of jove relentless power
daughter to that good earl once president
degenerate douglas o the unworthy lord 
diaphenia like the daffadowndilly
doth then the world go thus doth all thus move 
down in yon garden sweet and gay
drink to me only with thine eyes
duncan gray cam here to woo


earl march look'd on his dying child
earth has not anything to show more fair
eternal spirit of the chainless mind 
ethereal minstrel pilgrim of the sky 
ever let the fancy roam


fair daffodils we weep to see
fair pledges of a fruitful tree
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
fear no more the heat o' the sun
for ever fortune wilt thou prove
forget not yet the tried intent
four seasons fill the measure of the year
from harmony from heavenly harmony
from stirling castle we had seen
full fathom five thy father lies


gather ye rose-buds while ye may
gem of the crimson-colour'd even
go fetch to me a pint o' wine
go lovely rose 


hail to thee blithe spirit 
happy the man whose wish and care
happy those early days when i
he is gone on the mountain
he that loves a rosy cheek
hence all you vain delights
hence loath d melancholy
hence vain deluding joys
how delicious is the winning
how happy is he born and taught
how like a winter hath my absence been
how sleep the brave who sink to rest
how sweet the answer echo makes
how vainly men themselves amaze


i am monarch of all i survey
i arise from dreams of thee
i dream'd that as i wander'd by the way
if aught of oaten stop or pastoral song
if doughty deeds my lady please
i fear thy kisses gentle maiden
if thou survive my well-contented day
if to be absent were to be
if women could be fair and yet not fond
i have had playmates i have had companions
i heard a thousand blended notes
i met a traveller from an antique land
i'm wearing awa' jean
in a drear-nighted december
in the downhill of life when i find i'm declining
in the sweet shire of cardigan
i remember i remember
i saw where in the shroud did lurk
it is a beauteous evening calm and free
it is not beauty i demand
it is not growing like a tree
i travell'd among unknown men
it was a lover and his lass
it was a summer evening
i've heard them lilting at our ewe-milking
i wander'd lonely as a cloud
i was thy neighbour once thou rugged pile 
i wish i were where helen lies


john anderson my jo john


lawrence of virtuous father virtuous son
let me not to the marriage of true minds
life i know not what thou art
life of life thy lips enkindle
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
like to the clear in highest sphere
love not me for comely grace
lo where the rosy-bosom'd hours


many a green isle needs must be
mary i want a lyre with other strings
milton thou shouldst be living at this hour
mine be a cot beside the hill
mortality behold and fear
most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
much have i travell'd in the realms of gold
music when soft voices die
my days among the dead are past
my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains
my heart leaps up when i behold
my love in her attire doth show her wit
my lute be as thou wert when thou didst grow
my thoughts hold mortal strife
my true-love hath my heart and i have his


no longer mourn for me when i am dead
not a drum was heard not a funeral note
not celia that i juster am
now the golden morn aloft
now the last day of many days


o blithe new-comer i have heard
o brignall banks are wild and fair
of all the girls that are so smart
of a' the airts the wind can blaw
of nelson and the north
o friend i know not which way i must look
of this fair volume which we world do name
oft in the stilly night
o if thou knew'st how thou thyself dost harm
oh lovers' eyes are sharp to see
oh snatch'd away in beauty's bloom 
o listen listen ladies gay 
o mary at thy window be
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
o mistress mine where are you roaming 
o my luve's like a red red rose
on a day alack the day 
on a poet's lips i slept
once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
one more unfortunate
one word is too often profaned
o never say that i was false of heart
on linden when the sun was low
o saw ye bonnie lesley
o say what is that thing call'd light
o talk not to me of a name great in story
our bugles sang truce for the night-cloud had lower'd
over the mountains
o waly waly up the bank
o what can ail thee knight-at-arms
o wild west wind thou breath of autumn's being
o world o life o time 


pack clouds away and welcome day
phoebus arise 
pibroch of donuil dhu
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
proud maisie is in the wood


queen and huntress chaste and fair


rarely rarely comest thou
ruin seize thee ruthless king 


season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
shall i compare thee to a summer's day 
shall i wasting in despair
she dwelt among the untrodden ways
she is not fair to outward view
she walks in beauty like the night
she was a phantom of delight
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
since there's no help come let us kiss and part
sleep on and dream of heaven awhile
souls of poets dead and gone
spring the sweet spring is the year's pleasant king
star that bringest home the bee
stern daughter of the voice of god 
surprised by joy--impatient as the wind
sweet be not proud of those two eyes
sweet highland girl a very shower
sweet stream that winds through yonder glade
swiftly walk over the western wave


take o take those lips away
tax not the royal saint with vain expense
tell me not sweet i am unkind
tell me where is fancy bred
that time of year thou may'st in me behold
that which her slender waist confined
the curfew tolls the knell of parting day
the forward youth that would appear
the fountains mingle with the river
the glories of our blood and state
the last and greatest herald of heaven's king
the lovely lass o' inverness
the merchant to secure his treasure
the more we live more brief appear
the poplars are fell'd farewell to the shade
the sun is warm the sky is clear
the sun upon the lake is low
the twentieth year is well-nigh past
the world is too much with us late and soon
the world's a bubble and the life of man
there be none of beauty's daughters
there is a flower the lesser celandine
there is a garden in her face
there's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
there was a time when meadow grove and stream
they that have power to hurt and will do none
this is the month and this the happy morn
this life which seems so fair
three years she grew in sun and shower
thy braes were bonnie yarrow stream
thy hue dear pledge is pure and bright
timely blossom infant fair
tired with all these for restful death i cry
toll for the brave
to me fair friend you never can be old
'twas at the royal feast for persia won
'twas on a lofty vase's side
two voices are there one is of the sea


under the greenwood tree


verse a breeze 'mid blossoms straying
victorious men of earth no more


waken lords and ladies gay
wee sleekit cow'rin' tim'rous beastie
were i as base as is the lowly plain
we talk'd with open heart and tongue
we walk'd along while bright and red
we watch'd her breathing thro' the night
whenas in silks my julia goes
when britain first at heaven's command
when first the fiery-mantled sun
when god at first made man
when he who adores thee has left but the name
when icicles hang by the wall
when i consider how my light is spent
when i have borne in memory what has tamed
when i have fears that i may cease to be
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
when in the chronicle of wasted time
when lovely woman stoops to folly
when love with unconfined wings
when maidens such as hester die
when music heavenly maid was young
when ruth was left half desolate
when the lamp is shatter'd
when the sheep are in the fauld and the kye at hame
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
when we two parted
where art thou my beloved son
where shall the lover rest
where the remote bermudas ride
while that the sun with his beams hot
whoe'er she be
why art thou silent is thy love a plant
why damon with the forward day
why so pale and wan fond lover 
why weep ye by the tide ladie 
with little here to do or see


ye banks and braes and streams around
ye banks and braes o' bonnie doon
ye distant spires ye antique towers
ye mariners of england
yes there is holy pleasure in thine eye 
yet once more o ye laurels and once more
you meaner beauties of the night

fair flower that dost so comely grow 
hid in this silent dull retreat 
untouched thy honey'd blossoms blow 
unseen thy little branches greet 
no roving foot shall crush thee here 
no busy hand provoke a tear 

by nature's self in white arrayed 
she bade thee shun the vulgar eye 
and planted here the guardian shade 
and sent soft waters murmuring by 
thus quietly thy summer goes --
thy days declining to repose 

smit with those charms that must decay 
i grieve to see your future doom 
they died--nor were those flowers more gay--
the flowers that did in eden bloom 
unpitying frosts and autumn's power
shall leave no vestige of this flower 

from morning suns and evening dews
at first thy little being came 
if nothing once you nothing lose 
for when you die you are the same 
the space between is but an hour 
the frail duration of a flower 






song 


who has robbed the ocean cave 
to tinge thy lips with coral hue 
who from india's distant wave
for thee those pearly treasures drew 
who from yonder orient sky
stole the morning of thine eye 

thousand charms thy form to deck 
from sea and earth and air are torn 
roses bloom upon thy cheek 
on thy breath their fragrance borne 
guard thy bosom from the day 
lest thy snows should melt away 

but one charm remains behind 
which mute earth can ne'er impart 
nor in ocean wilt thou find 
nor in the circling air a heart 
fairest wouldst thou perfect be 
take oh take that heart from me 






 my life is like the summer rose 


my life is like the summer rose
that opens to the morning sky 
but ere the shades of evening close 
is scattered on the ground--to die 
yet on the rose's humble bed
the sweetest dews of night are shed 
as if she wept the waste to see --
but none shall weep a tear for me 

my life is like the autumn leaf
that trembles in the moon's pale ray 
its hold is frail --its date is brief 
restless --and soon to pass away 
yet ere that leaf shall fall and fade 
the parent tree will mourn its shade 
the winds bewail the leafless tree --
but none shall breathe a sigh for me 

my life is like the prints which feet
have left on tampa's desert strand 
soon as the rising tide shall beat 
all trace will vanish from the sand 
yet as if grieving to efface
all vestige of the human race 
on that lone shore loud moans the sea --
but none alas shall mourn for me 






 o fairest of the rural maids 


o fairest of the rural maids 
thy birth was in the forest shades 
green boughs and glimpses of the sky 
were all that met thine infant eye 

thy sports thy wanderings when a child 
were ever in the sylvan wild 
and all the beauty of the place
is in thy heart and on thy face 

the twilight of the trees and rocks
is in the light shade of thy locks 
thy step is as the wind that weaves
its playful way among the leaves 

thine eyes are springs in whose serene
and silent waters heaven is seen 
their lashes are the herbs that look
on their young figures in the brook 

the forest depths by foot unpressed 
are not more sinless than thy breast 
the holy peace that fills the air
of those calm solitudes is there 






the bucket 


how dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood 
when fond recollection presents them to view --
the orchard the meadow the deep-tangled wild-wood 
and every loved spot which my infancy knew 
the wide-spreading pond and the mill that stood by it 
the bridge and the rock where the cataract fell 
the cot of my father the dairy-house nigh it 
and e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well --
the old oaken bucket the iron-bound bucket 
the moss-covered bucket which hung in the well 

that moss-covered vessel i hailed as a treasure 
for often at noon when returned from the field 
i found it the source of an exquisite pleasure --
the purest and sweetest that nature can yield 
how ardent i seized it with hands that were glowing 
and quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell 
then soon with the emblem of truth overflowing 
and dripping with coolness it rose from the well 
the old oaken bucket the iron-bound bucket 
the moss-covered bucket arose from the well 

how sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it 
as poised on the curb it inclined to my lips 
not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it 
the brightest that beauty or revelry sips 
and now far removed from the loved habitation 
the tear of regret will intrusively swell 
as fancy reverts to my father's plantation 
and sighs for the bucket that hangs in the well --
the old oaken bucket the iron-bound bucket 
the moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well 






annabel lee 


it was many and many a year ago 
in a kingdom by the sea 
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee 
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me 

i was a child and she was a child 
in this kingdom by the sea 
but we loved with a love that was more than love 
i and my annabel lee 
with a love that the wing d seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me 

and this was the reason that long ago 
in this kingdom by the sea 
a wind blew out of a cloud chilling
my beautiful annabel lee 
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me 
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea 

the angels not half so happy in heaven 
went envying her and me 
yes that was the reason as all men know 
in this kingdom by the sea 
that the wind came out of the cloud by night 
chilling and killing my annabel lee 

but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we 
of many far wiser than we 
and neither the angels in heaven above 
nor the demons down under the sea 
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee 

for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee 
and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee 
and so all the night-tide i lie down by the side
of my darling --my darling --my life and my bride 
in her sepulchre there by the sea 
in her tomb by the sounding sea 






a health 


i fill this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone --
a woman of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon 
to whom the better elements
and kindly stars have given
a form so fair that like the air 
'tis less of earth than heaven 

her every tone is music's own 
like those of morning birds 
and something more than melody
dwells ever in her words 
the coinage of her heart are they 
and from her lips each flows
as one may see the burden'd bee
forth issue from the rose 

affections are as thoughts to her 
the measures of her hours 
her feelings have the fragrancy 
the freshness of young flowers 
and lovely passions changing oft 
so fill her she appears
the image of themselves by turns --
the idol of past years 

of her bright face one glance will trace
a picture on the brain 
and of her voice in echoing hearts
a sound must long remain 
but memory such as mine of her 
so very much endears 
when death is nigh my latest sigh
will not be life's but hers 

i fill this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone --
a woman of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon 
her health and would on earth there stood
some more of such a frame 
that life might be all poetry 
and weariness a name 






a serenade 


look out upon the stars my love 
and shame them with thine eyes 
on which than on the lights above 
there hang more destinies 
night's beauty is the harmony
of blending shades and light 
then lady up --look out and be
a sister to the night 

sleep not --thine image wakes for aye
within my watching breast 
sleep not --from her soft sleep should fly 
who robs all hearts of rest 
nay lady from thy slumbers break 
and make this darkness gay 
with looks whose brightness well might make
of darker nights a day 






the city in the sea 


lo death has reared himself a throne
in a strange city lying alone
far down within the dim west 
where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
have gone to their eternal rest 
there shrines and palaces and towers
 time-eaten towers that tremble not 
resemble nothing that is ours 
around by lifting winds forgot 
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie 

no rays from the holy heaven come down
on the long night-time of that town 
but light from out the lurid sea
streams up the turrets silently 
gleams up the pinnacles far and free 
up domes up spires up kingly halls 
up fanes up babylon-like walls 
up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers 
up many and many a marvellous shrine 
whose wreath d friezes intertwine
the viol the violet and the vine 

resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie 
so blend the turrets and shadows there
that all seem pendulous in air 
while from a proud tower in the town
death looks gigantically down 

there open fanes and gaping graves
yawn level with the luminous waves 
but not the riches there that lie
in each idol's diamond eye --
not the gaily-jewelled dead
tempt the waters from their bed 
for no ripples curl alas 
along that wilderness of glass 
no swellings tell that winds may be
upon some far-off happier sea 
no heavings hint that winds have been
on seas less hideously serene 

but lo a stir is in the air 
the wave--there is a movement there 
as if the towers had thrust aside 
in slightly sinking the dull tide 
as if their tops had feebly given
a void within the filmy heaven 
the waves have now a redder glow 
the hours are breathing faint and low 
and when amid no earthly moans 
down down that town shall settle hence 
hell rising from a thousand thrones 
shall do it reverence 






to the past 


thou unrelenting past 
strong are the barriers round thy dark domain 
and fetters sure and fast 
hold all that enter thy unbreathing reign 

far in thy realm withdrawn 
old empires sit in sullenness and gloom 
and glorious ages gone
lie deep within the shadow of thy womb 

childhood with all its mirth 
youth manhood age that draws us to the ground 
and last man's life on earth 
glide to thy dim dominions and are bound 

thou hast my better years 
thou hast my earlier friends the good the kind 
yielded to thee with tears --
the venerable form the exalted mind 

my spirit yearns to bring
the lost ones back --yearns with desire intense 
and struggles hard to wring
thy bolts apart and pluck thy captives thence 

in vain thy gates deny
all passage save to those who hence depart 
nor to the streaming eye
thou giv'st them back --nor to the broken heart 

in thy abysses hide
beauty and excellence unknown to thee
earth's wonder and her pride
are gathered as the waters to the sea 

labors of good to man 
unpublished charity unbroken faith 
love that midst grief began 
and grew with years and faltered not in death 

full many a mighty name
lurks in thy depths unuttered unrevered 
with thee are silent fame 
forgotten arts and wisdom disappeared 

thine for a space are they --
yet shalt thou yield thy treasures up at last 
thy gates shall yet give way 
thy bolts shall fall inexorable past 

all that of good and fair
has gone into thy womb from earliest time 
shall then come forth to wear
the glory and the beauty of its prime 

they have not perished --no 
kind words remembered voices once so sweet 
smiles radiant long ago 
and features the great soul's apparent seat 

all shall come back each tie
of pure affection shall be knit again 
alone shall evil die 
and sorrow dwell a prisoner in thy reign 

and then shall i behold
him by whose kind paternal side i sprung 
and her who still and cold 
fills the next grave --the beautiful and young 






israfel 

and the angel israfel whose heart-strings are a lute and who
has the sweetest voice of all god's creatures 

-- koran 


in heaven a spirit doth dwell
whose heart-strings are a lute 
none sing so wildly well
as the angel israfel 
and the giddy stars so legends tell 
ceasing their hymns attend the spell
of his voice all mute 

tottering above
in her highest noon 
the enamored moon
blushes with love 
while to listen the red levin
 with the rapid pleiads even 
which were seven 
pauses in heaven 

and they say the starry choir
and the other listening things 
that israfeli's fire
is owing to that lyre
by which he sits and sings --
the trembling living wire
of those unusual strings 

but the skies that angel trod 
where deep thoughts are a duty 
where love's a grown-up god 
where the houri glances are
imbued with all the beauty
which we worship in a star 

therefore thou art not wrong 
israfeli who despisest
an unimpassioned song 
to thee the laurels belong 
best bard because the wisest 
merrily live and long 

the ecstasies above
with thy burning measures suit 
thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love 
with the fervor of thy lute 
well may the stars be mute 

yes heaven is thine but this
is a world of sweets and sours 
our flowers are merely--flowers 
and the shadow of thy perfect bliss
is the sunshine of ours 

if i could dwell
where israfel
hath dwelt and he where i 
he might not sing so wildly well
a mortal melody 
while a bolder note than this might swell
from my lyre within the sky 






unseen spirits 


the shadows lay along broadway --
'twas near the twilight-tide --
and slowly there a lady fair
was walking in her pride 
alone walked she but viewlessly 
walked spirits at her side 

peace charmed the street beneath her feet 
and honor charmed the air 
and all astir looked kind on her 
and called her good as fair--
for all god ever gave to her
she kept with chary care 

she kept with care her beauties rare
from lovers warm and true 
for her heart was cold to all but gold 
and the rich came not to woo 
but honored well are charms to sell 
if priests the selling do 

now walking there was one more fair --
a slight girl lily-pale 
and she had unseen company
to make the spirit quail --
'twixt want and scorn she walked forlorn 
and nothing could avail 

no mercy now can clear her brow
for this world's peace to pray 
for as love's wild prayer dissolved in air 
her woman's heart gave way 
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven
by man is cursed alway 






the haunted palace 


in the greenest of our valleys
by good angels tenanted 
once a fair and stately palace--
radiant palace--reared its head 
in the monarch thought's dominion 
it stood there 
never seraph spread a pinion
over fabric half so fair 

banners yellow glorious golden 
on its roof did float and flow
 this--all this--was in the olden
time long ago 
and every gentle air that dallied 
in that sweet day 
along the ramparts plumed and pallid 
a wing d odor went away 

wanderers in that happy valley
through two luminous windows saw
spirits moving musically 
to a lute's well-tun d law 
round about a throne where sitting 
porphyrogene 
in state his glory well befitting 
the ruler of the realm was seen 

and all with pearl and ruby glowing
was the fair palace door 
through which came flowing flowing flowing 
and sparkling evermore 
a troop of echoes whose sweet duty
was but to sing 
in voices of surpassing beauty 
the wit and wisdom of their king 

but evil things in robes of sorrow 
assailed the monarch's high estate 
 ah let us mourn for never morrow
shall dawn upon him desolate 
and round about his home the glory
that blushed and bloomed
is but a dim-remembered story
of the old time entombed 

and travellers now within that valley
through the red-litten windows see
vast forms that move fantastically
to a discordant melody 
while like a ghastly rapid river 
through the pale door
a hideous throng rush out forever 
and laugh--but smile no more 






to a waterfowl 


whither midst falling dew 
while glow the heavens with the last steps of day 
far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue
thy solitary way 

vainly the fowler's eye
might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong 
as darkly painted on the crimson sky 
thy figure floats along 

seek'st thou the plashy brink
of weedy lake or marge of river wide 
or where the rocking billows rise and sink
on the chafed ocean-side 

there is a power whose care
teaches thy way along that pathless coast--
the desert and illimitable air--
lone wandering but not lost 

all day thy wings have fanned 
at that far height the cold thin atmosphere 
yet stoop not weary to the welcome land 
though the dark night is near 

and soon that toil shall end 
soon shalt thou find a summer home and rest 
and scream among thy fellows reeds shall bend 
soon o'er thy sheltered nest 

thou'rt gone the abyss of heaven
hath swallowed up thy form yet on my heart
deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given 
and shall not soon depart 

he who from zone to zone 
guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight 
in the long way that i must tread alone 
will lead my steps aright 






to helen 


helen thy beauty is to me
like those nic an barks of yore 
that gently o'er a perfumed sea 
the weary wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore 

on desperate seas long wont to roam 
thy hyacinth hair thy classic face 
thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece
and the grandeur that was rome 

lo in yon brilliant window-niche
how statue-like i see thee stand 
the agate lamp within thy hand 
ah psyche from the regions which
are holy land 






sparkling and bright 


sparkling and bright in liquid light
does the wine our goblets gleam in 
with hue as red as the rosy bed
which a bee would choose to dream in 
then fill to-night with hearts as light 
to loves as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim 
and break on the lips while meeting 

oh if mirth might arrest the flight
of time through life's dominions 
we here awhile would now beguile
the graybeard of his pinions 
to drink to-night with hearts as light 
to loves as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim 
and break on the lips while meeting 

but since delight can't tempt the wight 
nor fond regret delay him 
nor love himself can hold the elf 
nor sober friendship stay him 
we'll drink to-night with hearts as light 
to loves as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim 
and break on the lips while meeting 






to one in paradise 


thou wast all that to me love 
for which my soul did pine 
a green isle in the sea love 
a fountain and a shrine
all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers 
and all the flowers were mine 

ah dream too bright to last 
ah starry hope that didst arise
but to be overcast 
a voice from out the future cries 
 on on --but o'er the past
 dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
mute motionless aghast 

for alas alas with me
the light of life is o'er 
no more--no more--no more--
 such language holds the solemn sea
to the sands upon the shore 
shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree 
or the stricken eagle soar 

and all my days are trances 
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy gray eye glances 
and where thy footstep gleams --
in what ethereal dances 
by what eternal streams 






on the death of joseph rodman drake 


green be the turf above thee 
friend of my better days 
none knew thee but to love thee 
nor named thee but to praise 

tears fell when thou wert dying 
from eyes unused to weep 
and long where thou art lying 
will tears the cold turf steep 

when hearts whose truth was proven 
like thine are laid in earth 
there should a wreath be woven
to tell the world their worth 

and i who woke each morrow
to clasp thy hand in mine 
who shared thy joy and sorrow 
whose weal and woe were thine 

it should be mine to braid it
around thy faded brow 
but i've in vain essayed it 
and feel i cannot now 

while memory bids me weep thee 
nor thoughts nor words are free 
the grief is fixed too deeply
that mourns a man like thee 






the valley of unrest 


once it smiled a silent dell
where the people did not dwell 
they had gone unto the wars 
trusting to the mild-eyed stars 
nightly from their azure towers 
to keep watch above the flowers 
in the midst of which all day
the red sunlight lazily lay 
now each visitor shall confess
the sad valley's restlessness 
nothing there is motionless 
nothing save the airs that brood
over the magic solitude 
ah by no wind are stirred those trees
that palpitate like the chill seas
around the misty hebrides 
ah by no wind those clouds are driven
that rustle through the unquiet heaven
uneasily from morn to even 
over the violets there that lie
in myriad types of the human eye 
over the lilies there that wave
and weep above a nameless grave 
they wave --from out their fragrant tops
eternal dews come down in drops 
they weep --from off their delicate stems
perennial tears descend in gems 






to the fringed gentian 


thou blossom bright with autumn dew 
and colored with the heaven's own blue 
that openest when the quiet light
succeeds the keen and frosty night 

thou comest not when violets lean
o'er wandering brooks and springs unseen 
or columbines in purple dressed 
nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest 

thou waitest late and com'st alone 
when woods are bare and birds are flown 
and frosts and shortening days portend
the aged year is near his end 

then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
look through its fringes to the sky 
blue--blue--as if that sky let fall
a flower from its cerulean wall 

i would that thus when i shall see
the hour of death draw near to me 
hope blossoming within my heart 
may look to heaven as i depart 






the crowded street 


let me move slowly through the street 
filled with an ever-shifting train 
amid the sound of steps that beat
the murmuring walks like autumn rain 

how fast the flitting figures come 
the mild the fierce the stony face --
some bright with thoughtless smiles and some
where secret tears have left their trace 

they pass--to toil to strife to rest 
to halls in which the feast is spread 
to chambers where the funeral guest
in silence sits beside the dead 

and some to happy homes repair 
where children pressing cheek to cheek 
with mute caresses shall declare
the tenderness they cannot speak 

and some who walk in calmness here 
shall shudder as they reach the door
where one who made their dwelling dear 
its flower its light is seen no more 

youth with pale cheek and slender frame 
and dreams of greatness in thine eye 
go'st thou to build an early name 
or early in the task to die 

keen son of trade with eager brow 
who is now fluttering in thy snare 
thy golden fortunes tower they now 
or melt the glittering spires in air 

who of this crowd to-night shall tread
the dance till daylight gleam again 
who sorrow o'er the untimely dead 
who writhe in throes of mortal pain 

some famine-struck shall think how long
the cold dark hours how slow the light 
and some who flaunt amid the throng 
shall hide in dens of shame to-night 

each where his tasks or pleasures call 
they pass and heed each other not 
there is who heeds who holds them all
in his large love and boundless thought 

these struggling tides of life that seem
in wayward aimless course to tend 
are eddies of the mighty stream
that rolls to its appointed end 






the raven 


once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary 
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore --
while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping 
as of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door 
 'tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door --
only this and nothing more 

ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december 
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor 
eagerly i wished the morrow --vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore --
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore --
nameless here forevermore 

and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before 
so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
 'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door 
--some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door --
this it is and nothing more 

presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer 
 sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore 
but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping 
and so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door 
that i scarce was sure i heard you --here i opened wide the door --
darkness there and nothing more 

deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing 
doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before 
but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token 
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore 
this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore 
merely this and nothing more 

back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning 
soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before 
 surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice 
let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --
let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore --
'tis the wind and nothing more 

open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter 
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore 
not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he 
but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door--
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door--
perched and sat and nothing more 

then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore 
 though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure
no craven 
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore --
tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore 
quoth the raven nevermore 

much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly 
though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore 
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door--
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door 
with such name as nevermore 

but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour 
nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before--
on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before 
then the bird said nevermore 

startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken 
 doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store 
caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore 
till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
of 'never--nevermore ' 

but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling 
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door 
then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking
fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking nevermore 

this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core 
this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining
on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er 
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
 she shall press ah nevermore 

then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor 
 wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee--by these angels he hath
sent thee
respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore 
quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore 
quoth the raven nevermore 

 prophet said i thing of evil --prophet still if bird or devil --
whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore 
desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted--
on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly i implore --
is there -- is there balm in gilead --tell me--tell me i implore 
quoth the raven nevermore 

 prophet said i thing of evil --prophet still if bird or devil 
by that heaven that bends above us--by that god we both adore--
tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn 
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore--
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore 
quoth the raven nevermore 

 be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked 
upstarting --
 get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore 
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken 
leave my loneliness unbroken --quit the bust above my door 
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door 
quoth the raven nevermore 

and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door 
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming 
and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor 
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted --nevermore 






the battle-field 


once this soft turf this rivulet's sands 
were trampled by a hurrying crowd 
and fiery hearts and arm d hands
encountered in the battle-cloud 

ah never shall the land forget
how gushed the life-blood of her brave --
gushed warm with hope and courage yet 
upon the soil they fought to save 

now all is calm and fresh and still 
alone the chirp of flitting bird 
and talk of children on the hill 
and bell of wandering kine are heard 

no solemn host goes trailing by
the black-mouthed gun and staggering wain 
men start not at the battle-cry 
oh be it never heard again 

soon rested those who fought but thou
who minglest in the harder strife
for truths which men receive not now 
thy warfare only ends with life 

a friendless warfare lingering long
through weary day and weary year 
a wild and many-weaponed throng
hang on thy front and flank and rear 

yet nerve thy spirit to the proof 
and blench not at thy chosen lot 
the timid good may stand aloof 
the sage may frown --yet faint thou not 

nor heed the shaft too surely cast 
the foul and hissing bolt of scorn 
for with thy side shall dwell at last 
the victory of endurance born 

truth crushed to earth shall rise again 
the eternal years of god are hers 
but error wounded writhes in pain 
and dies among his worshippers 

yea though thou lie upon the dust 
when they who helped thee flee in fear 
die full of hope and manly trust 
like those who fell in battle here 

another hand thy sword shall wield 
another hand the standard wave 
till from the trumpet's mouth is pealed
the blast of triumph o'er thy grave 






the sleeper 


at midnight in the month of june 
i stand beneath the mystic moon 
an opiate vapor dewy dim 
exhales from out her golden rim 
and softly dripping drop by drop 
upon the quiet mountain-top 
steals drowsily and musically
into the universal valley 
the rosemary nods upon the grave 
the lily lolls upon the wave 
wrapping the fog about its breast 
the ruin moulders into rest 
looking like lethe see the lake
a conscious slumber seems to take 
and would not for the world awake 
all beauty sleeps --and lo where lies
irene with her destinies 

o lady bright can it be right 
this window open to the night 
the wanton airs from the tree-top
laughingly through the lattice drop 
the bodiless airs a wizard rout 
flit through thy chamber in and out 
and wave the curtain canopy
so fitfully so fearfully 
above the closed and fringed lid
'neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid 
that o'er the floor and down the wall 
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall 
o lady dear hast thou no fear 
why and what art thou dreaming here 
sure thou art come o'er far-off seas 
a wonder to these garden trees 
strange is thy pallor strange thy dress 
strange above all thy length of tress 
and this all solemn silentness 

the lady sleeps oh may her sleep 
which is enduring so be deep 
heaven have her in its sacred keep 
this chamber changed for one more holy 
this bed for one more melancholy 
i pray to god that she may lie
forever with unopened eye 
while the pale sheeted ghosts go by 

my love she sleeps oh may her sleep 
as it is lasting so be deep 
soft may the worms about her creep 
far in the forest dim and old 
for her may some tall vault unfold 
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and wing d panels fluttering back 
triumphant o'er the crested palls
of her grand family funerals 
some sepulchre remote alone 
against whose portal she hath thrown 
in childhood many an idle stone 
some tomb from out whose sounding door
she ne'er shall force an echo more 
thrilling to think poor child of sin 
it was the dead who groaned within 












nature 


as a fond mother when the day is o'er 
leads by the hand her little child to bed 
half willing half reluctant to be led 
and leave his broken playthings on the floor 
still gazing at them through the open door 
nor wholly reassured and comforted
by promises of others in their stead 
which though more splendid may not please him more --
so nature deals with us and takes away
our playthings one by one and by the hand
leads us to rest so gently that we go
scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay 
being too full of sleep to understand
how far the unknown transcends the what we know 






hebe 


i saw the twinkle of white feet 
i saw the flash of robes descending 
before her ran an influence fleet 
that bowed my heart like barley bending 

as in bare fields the searching bees
pilot to blooms beyond our finding 
it led me on by sweet degrees
joy's simple honey-cells unbinding 

those graces were that seemed grim fates 
with nearer love the sky leaned o'er me 
the long-sought secret's golden gates
on musical hinges swung before me 

i saw the brimmed bowl in her grasp
thrilling with godhood like a lover
i sprang the proffered life to clasp --
the beaker fell the luck was over 

the earth has drunk the vintage up 
what boots it patch the goblet's splinters 
can summer fill the icy cup 
whose treacherous crystal is but winter's 

o spendthrift haste await the gods 
their nectar crowns the lips of patience 
haste scatters on unthankful sods
the immortal gift in vain libations 

coy hebe flies from those that woo 
and shuns the hands would seize upon her 
follow thy life and she will sue
to pour for thee the cup of honor 






the day is done 


the day is done and the darkness
falls from the wings of night 
as a feather is wafted downward
from an eagle in his flight 

i see the lights of the village
gleam through the rain and the mist 
and a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
that my soul cannot resist 

a feeling of sadness and longing 
that is not akin to pain 
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain 

come read to me some poem 
some simple and heartfelt lay 
that shall soothe this restless feeling 
and banish the thoughts of day 

not from the grand old masters 
not from the bards sublime 
whose distant footsteps echo
through the corridors of time 

for like strains of martial music 
their mighty thoughts suggest
life's endless toil and endeavor 
and to-night i long for rest 

read from some humbler poet 
whose songs gushed from his heart 
as showers from the clouds of summer 
or tears from the eyelids start 

who through long days of labor 
and nights devoid of ease 
still heard in his soul the music
of wonderful melodies 

such songs have power to quiet
the restless pulse of care 
and come like the benediction
that follows after prayer 

then read from the treasured volume
the poem of thy choice 
and lend to the rhyme of the poet
the beauty of thy voice 

and the night shall be filled with music 
and the cares that infest the day
shall fold their tents like the arabs 
and as silently steal away 






ichabod 


so fallen so lost the light withdrawn
which once he wore 
the glory from his gray hairs gone
forevermore 

revile him not --the tempter hath
a snare for all 
and pitying tears not scorn and wrath 
befit his fall 

oh dumb be passion's stormy rage 
when he who might
have lighted up and led his age 
falls back in night 

scorn would the angels laugh to mark
a bright soul driven 
fiend-goaded down the endless dark 
from hope and heaven 

let not the land once proud of him
insult him now 
nor brand with deeper shame his dim 
dishonored brow 

but let its humbled sons instead 
from sea to lake 
a long lament as for the dead 
in sadness make 

of all we loved and honored naught
save power remains --
a fallen angel's pride of thought 
still strong in chains 

all else is gone from those great eyes
the soul has fled 
when faith is lost when honor dies 
the man is dead 

then pay the reverence of old days
to his dead fame 
walk backward with averted gaze 
and hide the shame 






sir humphrey gilbert 


southward with fleet of ice
sailed the corsair death 
wild and fast blew the blast 
and the east-wind was his breath 

his lordly ships of ice
glisten in the sun 
on each side like pennons wide 
flashing crystal streamlets run 

his sails of white sea-mist
dripped with silver rain 
but where he passed there were cast
leaden shadows o'er the main 

eastward from campobello
sir humphrey gilbert sailed 
three days or more seaward he bore 
then alas the land-wind failed 

alas the land-wind failed 
and ice-cold grew the night 
and nevermore on sea or shore 
should sir humphrey see the light 

he sat upon the deck 
the book was in his hand 
 do not fear heaven is as near 
he said by water as by land 

in the first watch of the night 
without a signal's sound 
out of the sea mysteriously 
the fleet of death rose all around 

the moon and the evening star
were hanging in the shrouds 
every mast as it passed 
seemed to rake the passing clouds 

they grappled with their prize 
at midnight black and cold 
as of a rock was the shock 
heavily the ground-swell rolled 

southward through day and dark 
they drift in close embrace 
with mist and rain o'er the open main 
yet there seems no change of place 

southward forever southward 
they drift through dark and day 
and like a dream in the gulf stream
sinking vanish all away 






concord hymn 

sung at the completion of the battle monument april 


by the rude bridge that arched the flood 
their flag to april's breeze unfurled 
here once the embattled farmers stood 
and fired the shot heard round the world 

the foe long since in silence slept 
alike the conqueror silent sleeps 
and time the ruined bridge has swept
down the dark stream which seaward creeps 

on this green bank by this soft stream 
we set to-day a votive stone 
that memory may their deed redeem 
when like our sires our sons are gone 

spirit that made those heroes dare
to die and leave their children free 
bid time and nature gently spare
the shaft we raise to them and thee 






to america 


what cringe to europe band it all in one 
stilt its decrepit strength renew its age 
wipe out its debts contract a loan to wage
its venal battles --and by yon bright sun 
our god is false and liberty undone 
if slaves have power to win your heritage 
look on your country god's appointed stage 
where man's vast mind its boundless course shall run 
for that it was your stormy coast he spread--
a fear in winter girded you about
with granite hills and made you strong and dread 
let him who fears before the foemen shout 
or gives an inch before a vein has bled 
turn on himself and let the traitor out 






old ironsides 


ay tear her tattered ensign down 
long has it waved on high 
and many an eye has danced to see
that banner in the sky 
beneath it rung the battle shout 
and burst the cannon's roar --
the meteor of the ocean air
shall sweep the clouds no more 

her deck once red with heroes' blood 
where knelt the vanquished foe 
when winds were hurrying o'er the flood 
and waves were white below 
no more shall feel the victor's tread 
or know the conquered knee 
the harpies of the shore shall pluck
the eagle of the sea 

oh better that her shattered hulk
should sink beneath the wave 
her thunders shook the mighty deep 
and there should be her grave 

nail to the mast her holy flag 
set every threadbare sail 
and give her to the god of storms 
the lightning and the gale 






to england 




lear and cordelia 'twas an ancient tale
before thy shakespeare gave it deathless fame 
the times have changed the moral is the same 
so like an outcast dowerless and pale 
thy daughter went and in a foreign gale
spread her young banner till its sway became
a wonder to the nations days of shame
are close upon thee prophets raise their wail 
when the rude cossack with an outstretched hand
points his long spear across the narrow sea --
 lo there is england when thy destiny
storms on thy straw-crowned head and thou dost stand
weak helpless mad a by-word in the land --
god grant thy daughter a cordelia be 






stand thou great bulwark of man's liberty 
thou rock of shelter rising from the wave 
sole refuge to the overwearied brave
who planned arose and battled to be free 
fell undeterred then sadly turned to thee 
saved the free spirit from their country's grave 
to rise again and animate the slave 
when god shall ripen all things britons ye
who guard the sacred outpost not in vain
hold your proud peril freemen undefiled 
keep watch and ward let battlements be piled
around your cliffs fleets marshalled till the main
sink under them and if your courage wane 
through force or fraud look westward to your child 








the wreck of the hesperus 


it was the schooner hesperus 
that sailed the wintry sea 
and the skipper had taken his little daught r 
to bear him company 

blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax 
her cheeks like the dawn of day 
and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds 
that ope in the month of may 

the skipper he stood beside the helm 
his pipe was in his mouth 
and he watched how the veering flaw did blow
the smoke now west now south 

then up and spake an old sail r 
had sailed to the spanish main 
 i pray thee put into yonder port 
for i fear a hurricane 

 last night the moon had a golden ring 
and to-night no moon we see 
the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe 
and a scornful laugh laughed he 

colder and louder blew the wind 
a gale from the northeast 
the snow fell hissing in the brine 
and the billows frothed like yeast 

down came the storm and smote amain
the vessel in its strength 
she shuddered and paused like a frightened steed 
then leaped her cable's length 

 come hither come hither my little daughter 
and do not tremble so 
for i can weather the roughest gale
that ever wind did blow 

he wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat
against the stinging blast 
he cut a rope from a broken spar 
and bound her to the mast 

 o father i hear the church-bells ring 
oh say what may it be 
 'tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast --
and he steered for the open sea 

 o father i hear the sound of guns 
oh say what may it be 
 some ship in distress that cannot live
in such an angry sea 

 o father i see a gleaming light 
oh say what may it be 
but the father answered never a word 
a frozen corpse was he 

lashed to the helm all stiff and stark 
with his face turned to the skies 
the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
on his fixed and glassy eyes 

then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
that sav d she might be 
and she thought of christ who stilled the wave 
on the lake of galilee 

and fast through the midnight dark and drear 
through the whistling sleet and snow 
like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept
tow'rds the reef of norman's woe 

and ever the fitful gusts between
a sound came from the land 
it was the sound of the trampling surf
on the rocks and the hard sea-sand 

the breakers were right beneath her bows 
she drifted a dreary wreck 
and a whooping billow swept the crew
like icicles from her deck 

she struck where the white and fleecy waves
looked soft as carded wool 
but the cruel rocks they gored her side
like the horns of an angry bull 

her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice 
with the masts went by the board 
like a vessel of glass she stove and sank 
ho ho the breakers roared 

at daybreak on the bleak sea-beach 
a fisherman stood aghast 
to see the form of a maiden fair 
lashed close to a drifting mast 

the salt sea was frozen on her breast 
the salt tears in her eyes 
and he saw her hair like the brown sea-weed 
on the billows fall and rise 

such was the wreck of the hesperus 
in the midnight and the snow 
christ save us all from a death like this 
on the reef of norman's woe 






bedouin song 


from the desert i come to thee
on a stallion shod with fire 
and the winds are left behind
in the speed of my desire 
under thy window i stand 
and the midnight hears my cry 
i love thee i love but thee 
with a love that shall not die
 till the sun grows cold 
 and the stars are old 
 and the leaves of the judgment book unfold 

look from thy window and see
my passion and my pain 
i lie on the sands below 
and i faint in thy disdain 
let the night-winds touch thy brow
with the heat of my burning sigh 
and melt thee to hear the vow
of a love that shall not die
 till the sun grows cold 
 and the stars are old 
 and the leaves of the judgment book unfold 

my steps are nightly driven 
by the fever in my breast 
to hear from thy lattice breathed
the word that shall give me rest 
open the door of thy heart 
and open thy chamber door 
and my kisses shall teach thy lips
the love that shall fade no more
 till the sun grows cold 
 and the stars are old 
 and the leaves of the judgment book unfold 






skipper ireson's ride 


of all the rides since the birth of time 
told in story or sung in rhyme --
on apuleius's golden ass 
or one-eyed calendar's horse of brass 
witch astride of a human back 
islam's prophet on al-borak --
the strangest ride that ever was sped
was ireson's out from marblehead 
old floyd ireson for his hard heart 
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead 

body of turkey head of owl 
wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl 
feathered and ruffled in every part 
skipper ireson stood in the cart 
scores of women old and young 
strong of muscle and glib of tongue 
pushed and pulled up the rocky lane 
shouting and singing the shrill refrain 
 here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt 
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead 

wrinkled scolds with hands on hips 
girls in bloom of cheek and lips 
wild-eyed free-limbed such as chase
bacchus round some antique vase 
brief of skirt with ankles bare 
loose of kerchief and loose of hair 
with conch-shells blowing and fish-horns' twang 
over and over the m nads sang 
 here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt 
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead 

small pity for him --he sailed away
from a leaking ship in chaleur bay --
sailed away from a sinking wreck 
with his own town's-people on her deck 
 lay by lay by they called to him 
back he answered sink or swim 
brag of your catch of fish again 
and off he sailed through the fog and rain 
old floyd ireson for his hard heart 
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead 

fathoms deep in dark chaleur
that wreck shall lie forevermore 
mother and sister wife and maid 
looked from the rocks of marblehead
over the moaning and rainy sea --
looked for the coming that might not be 
what did the winds and the sea-birds say
of the cruel captain who sailed away --
old floyd ireson for his hard heart 
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead 

through the street on either side 
up flew windows doors swung wide 
sharp-tongued spinsters old wives gray 
treble lent the fish-horn's bray 
sea-worn grandsires cripple-bound 
hulks of old sailors run aground 
shook head and fist and hat and cane 
and cracked with curses the hoarse refrain 
 here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt 
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead 

sweetly along the salem road
bloom of orchard and lilac showed 
little the wicked skipper knew
of the fields so green and the sky so blue 
riding there in his sorry trim 
like an indian idol glum and grim 
scarcely he seemed the sound to hear
of voices shouting far and near 
 here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt 
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead 

 hear me neighbors at last he cried --
 what to me is this noisy ride 
what is the shame that clothes the skin
to the nameless horror that lives within 
waking or sleeping i see a wreck 
and hear a cry from a reeling deck 
hate me and curse me --i only dread
the hand of god and the face of the dead 
said old floyd ireson for his hard heart 
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead 

then the wife of the skipper lost at sea
said god has touched him why should we 
said an old wife mourning her only son 
 cut the rogue's tether and let him run 
so with soft relentings and rude excuse 
half scorn half pity they cut him loose 
and gave him a cloak to hide him in 
and left him alone with his shame and sin 
poor floyd ireson for his hard heart 
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead 






the village blacksmith 


under a spreading chestnut-tree
the village smithy stands 
the smith a mighty man is he 
with large and sinewy hands 
and the muscles of his brawny arms
are strong as iron bands 

his hair is crisp and black and long 
his face is like the tan 
his brow is wet with honest sweat 
he earns whate'er he can 
and looks the whole world in the face 
for he owes not any man 

week in week out from morn till night 
you can hear his bellows blow 
you can hear him swing his heavy sledge 
with measured beat and slow 
like a sexton ringing the village bell 
when the evening sun is low 

and children coming home from school
look in at the open door 
they love to see the flaming forge 
and hear the bellows roar 
and catch the burning sparks that fly
like chaff from a threshing-floor 

he goes on sunday to the church 
and sits among his boys 
he hears the parson pray and preach 
he hears his daughter's voice 
singing in the village choir 
and it makes his heart rejoice 

it sounds to him like her mother's voice 
singing in paradise 
he needs must think of her once more 
how in the grave she lies 
and with his hard rough hand he wipes
a tear out of his eyes 

toiling --rejoicing --sorrowing 
onward through life he goes 
each morning sees some task begin 
each evening sees it close 
something attempted something done 
has earned a night's repose 

thanks thanks to thee my worthy friend 
for the lesson thou hast taught 
thus at the flaming forge of life
our fortunes must be wrought 
thus on its sounding anvil shaped
each burning deed and thought 






the last leaf 


i saw him once before 
as he passed by the door 
and again
the pavement stones resound 
as he totters o'er the ground
with his cane 

they say that in his prime 
ere the pruning-knife of time
cut him down 
not a better man was found
by the crier on his round
through the town 

but now he walks the streets 
and he looks at all he meets
sad and wan 
and he shakes his feeble head 
that it seems as if he said 
 they are gone 

the mossy marbles rest
on the lips that he has pressed
in their bloom 
and the names he loved to hear
have been carved for many a year
on the tomb 

my grandmamma has said--
poor old lady she is dead
long ago--
that he had a roman nose 
and his cheek was like a rose
in the snow 

but now his nose is thin 
and it rests upon his chin
like a staff 
and a crook is in his back 
and a melancholy crack
in his laugh 

i know it is a sin
for me to sit and grin
at him here 
but the old three-cornered hat 
and the breeches and all that 
are so queer 

and if i should live to be
the last leaf upon the tree
in the spring 
let them smile as i do now 
at the old forsaken bough
where i cling 






the old kentucky home 




the sun shines bright in the old kentucky home 
'tis summer the darkies are gay 
the corn-top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom 
while the birds make music all the day 
the young folks roll on the little cabin floor 
all merry all happy and bright 
by-'n'-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door --
then my old kentucky home good-night 

weep no more my lady 
oh weep no more to-day 
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home 
for the old kentucky home far away 

they hunt no more for the possum and the coon 
on the meadow the hill and the shore 
they sing no more by the glimmer of the moon 
on the bench by the old cabin door 
the day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart 
with sorrow where all was delight 
the time has come when the darkies have to part --
then my old kentucky home good-night 

the head must bow and the back will have to bend 
wherever the darkey may go 
a few more days and the trouble all will end 
in the field where the sugar-canes grow 
a few more days for to tote the weary load --
no matter 'twill never be light 
a few more days till we totter on the road --
then my old kentucky home good-night 

weep no more my lady 
oh weep no more to-day 
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home 
for the old kentucky home far away 






the black regiment 

port hudson may 


dark as the clouds of even 
ranked in the western heaven 
waiting the breath that lifts
all the dread mass and drifts
tempest and falling brand
over a ruined land --
so still and orderly 
arm to arm knee to knee 
waiting the great event 
stands the black regiment 

down the long dusky line
teeth gleam and eyeballs shine 
and the bright bayonet 
bristling and firmly set 
flashed with a purpose grand 
long ere the sharp command
of the fierce rolling drum
told them their time had come 
told them what work was sent
for the black regiment 

 now the flag-sergeant cried 
 though death and hell betide 
let the whole nation see
if we are fit to be
free in this land or bound
down like the whining hound --
bound with red stripes of pain
in our old chains again 
oh what a shout there went
from the black regiment 

 charge trump and drum awoke 
onward the bondmen broke 
bayonet and sabre-stroke
vainly opposed their rush 
through the wild battle's crush 
with but one thought aflush 
driving their lords like chaff 
in the guns' mouths they laugh 
or at the slippery brands
leaping with open hands 
down they tear man and horse 
down in their awful course 
trampling with bloody heel
over the crashing steel 
all their eyes forward bent 
rushed the black regiment 

 freedom their battle-cry --
 freedom or leave to die 
ah and they meant the word 
not as with us 'tis heard 
not a mere party shout 
they gave their spirits out 
trusted the end to god 
and on the gory sod
rolled in triumphant blood 
glad to strike one free blow 
whether for weal or woe 
glad to breathe one free breath 
though on the lips of death 
praying--alas in vain --
that they might fall again 
so they could once more see
that burst to liberty 
this was what freedom lent
to the black regiment 

hundreds on hundreds fell 
but they are resting well 
scourges and shackles strong
never shall do them wrong 
oh to the living few 
soldiers be just and true 
hail them as comrades tried 
fight with them side by side 
never in field or tent 
scorn the black regiment 






carolina 


the despot treads thy sacred sands 
thy pines give shelter to his bands 
thy sons stand by with idle hands 
carolina 
he breathes at ease thy airs of balm 
he scorns the lances of thy palm 
oh who shall break thy craven calm 
carolina 
thy ancient fame is growing dim 
a spot is on thy garment's rim 
give to the winds thy battle-hymn 
carolina 

call on thy children of the hill 
wake swamp and river coast and rill 
rouse all thy strength and all thy skill 
carolina 
cite wealth and science trade and art 
touch with thy fire the cautious mart 
and pour thee through the people's heart 
carolina 
till even the coward spurns his fears 
and all thy fields and fens and meres
shall bristle like thy palm with spears 
carolina 

i hear a murmur as of waves
that grope their way through sunless caves 
like bodies struggling in their graves 
carolina 
and now it deepens slow and grand
it swells as rolling to the land 
an ocean broke upon thy strand 
carolina 
shout let it reach the startled huns 
and roar with all thy festal guns 
it is the answer of thy sons 
carolina 






dirge for a soldier 


close his eyes his work is done 
what to him is friend or foeman 
rise of moon or set of sun 
hand of man or kiss of woman 
lay him low lay him low 
in the clover or the snow 
what cares he he cannot know 
lay him low 

as man may he fought his fight 
proved his truth by his endeavor 
let him sleep in solemn night 
sleep forever and forever 
lay him low lay him low 
in the clover or the snow 
what cares he he cannot know 
lay him low 

fold him in his country's stars 
roll the drum and fire the volley 
what to him are all our wars 
what but death bemocking folly 
lay him low lay him low 
in the clover or the snow 
what cares he he cannot know 
lay him low 

leave him to god's watching eye 
trust him to the hand that made him 
mortal love weeps idly by 
god alone has power to aid him 
lay him low lay him low 
in the clover or the snow 
what cares he he cannot know 
lay him low 






battle-hymn of the republic 


mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord 
he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored 
he hath loosed the fatal lightning of his terrible swift sword 
his truth is marching on 

i have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps 
they have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps 
i can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps 
his day is marching on 

i have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel 
 as ye deal with my contemners so with you my grace shall deal 
let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel 
since god is marching on 

he has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat 
he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat 
oh be swift my soul to answer him be jubilant my feet 
our god is marching on 

in the beauty of the lilies christ was born across the sea 
with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me 
as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free 
while god is marching on 






farragut 


farragut farragut 
old heart of oak 
daring dave farragut 
thunderbolt stroke 
watches the hoary mist
lift from the bay 
till his flag glory-kissed 
greets the young day 

far by gray morgan's walls 
looms the black fleet 
hark deck to rampart calls
with the drums' beat 
buoy your chains overboard 
while the steam hums 
men to the battlement 
farragut comes 

see as the hurricane
hurtles in wrath
squadrons of clouds amain
back from its path 
back to the parapet 
to the guns' lips 
thunderbolt farragut
hurls the black ships 

now through the battle's roar
clear the boy sings 
 by the mark fathoms four 
while his lead swings 
steady the wheelmen five
 nor' by east keep her 
 steady but two alive 
how the shells sweep her 

lashed to the mast that sways
over red decks 
over the flame that plays
round the torn wrecks 
over the dying lips
framed for a cheer 
farragut leads his ships 
guides the line clear 

on by heights cannon-browed 
while the spars quiver 
onward still flames the cloud
where the hulks shiver 
see yon fort's star is set 
storm and fire past 
cheer him lads --farragut 
lashed to the mast 

oh while atlantic's breast
bears a white sail 
while the gulf's towering crest
tops a green vale 
men thy bold deeds shall tell 
old heart of oak 
daring dave farragut 
thunderbolt stroke

she is not dead nor deaf nor dumb 
huzza she spurns the northern scum 
she breathes she burns she'll come 
she'll come

after all 


the apples are ripe in the orchard 
the work of the reaper is done 
and the golden woodlands redden
in the blood of the dying sun 

at the cottage door the grandsire
sits pale in his easy-chair 
while a gentle wind of twilight
plays with his silver hair 

a woman is kneeling beside him 
a fair young head is prest 
in the first wild passion of sorrow 
against his aged breast 

and far from over the distance
the faltering echoes come 
of the flying blast of trumpet 
and the rattling roll of drum 

and the grandsire speaks in a whisper 
 the end no man can see 
but we give him to his country 
and we give our prayers to thee 



the violets star the meadows 
the rose-buds fringe the door 
and over the grassy orchard
the pink-white blossoms pour 

but the grandsire's chair is empty 
the cottage is dark and still 
there's a nameless grave in the battle-field 
and a new one under the hill 

and a pallid tearless woman
by the cold hearth sits alone 
and the old clock in the corner
ticks on with a steady drone

the song of the camp 


 give us a song the soldiers cried 
the outer trenches guarding 
when the heated guns of the camps allied
grew weary of bombarding 

the dark redan in silent scoff 
lay grim and threatening under 
and the tawny mound of the malakoff
no longer belch'd its thunder 

there was a pause a guardsman said 
 we storm the forts to-morrow 
sing while we may another day
will bring enough of sorrow 

they lay along the battery's side 
below the smoking cannon 
brave hearts from severn and from clyde 
and from the banks of shannon 

they sang of love and not of fame 
forgot was britain's glory 
each heart recall'd a different name 
but all sang annie laurie 

voice after voice caught up the song 
until its tender passion
rose like an anthem rich and strong --
their battle-eve confession 

dear girl her name he dared not speak 
but as the song grew louder 
something upon the soldier's cheek
washed off the stains of powder 

beyond the darkening ocean burn'd
the bloody sunset's embers 
while the crimean valleys learn'd
how english love remembers 

and once again a fire of hell
rain'd on the russian quarters 
with scream of shot and burst of shell 
and bellowing of the mortars 

and irish nora's eyes are dim
for a singer dumb and gory 
and english mary mourns for him
who sang of annie laurie 

sleep soldiers still in honor'd rest
your truth and valor wearing 
the bravest are the tenderest --
the loving are the daring 






in the hospital 


i lay me down to sleep 
with little thought or care
whether my waking find
me here or there 

a bowing burdened head 
that only asks to rest 
unquestioning upon
a loving breast 

my good right hand forgets
its cunning now 
to march the weary march
i know not how 

i am not eager bold 
nor strong--all that is past 
i am ready not to do
at last at last 

my half day's work is done 
and this is all my part 
i give a patient god
my patient heart 

and grasp his banner still 
though all its blue be dim 
these stripes no less than stars 
lead after him 






under the violets 


her hands are cold her face is white 
no more her pulses come and go 
her eyes are shut to life and light --
fold the white vesture snow on snow 
and lay her where the violets blow 

but not beneath a graven stone 
to plead for tears with alien eyes 
a slender cross of wood alone
shall say that here a maiden lies
in peace beneath the peaceful skies 

and gray old trees of hugest limb
shall wheel their circling shadows round
to make the scorching sunlight dim
that drinks the greenness from the ground 
and drop their dead leaves on her mound 

when o'er their boughs the squirrels run 
and through their leaves the robins call 
and ripening in the autumn sun 
the acorns and the chestnuts fall 
doubt not that she will heed them all 

for her the morning choir shall sing
its matins from the branches high 
and every minstrel voice of spring 
that trills beneath the april sky 
shall greet her with its earliest cry 

when turning round their dial-track 
eastward the lengthening shadows pass 
her little mourners clad in black 
the crickets sliding through the grass 
shall pipe for her an evening mass 

at last the rootlets of the trees
shall find the prison where she lies 
and bear the buried dust they seize
in leaves and blossoms to the skies 
so may the soul that warmed it rise 

if any born of kindlier blood 
should ask what maiden lies below 
say only this a tender bud 
that tried to blossom in the snow 
lies withered where the violets blow

daughters of time the hypocritic days 
muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes 
and marching single in an endless file 
bring diadems and fagots in their hands 
to each they offer gifts after his will 
bread kingdoms stars and sky that holds them all 
i in my pleach d garden watched the pomp 
forgot my morning wishes hastily
took a few herbs and apples and the day
turned and departed silent i too late 
under her solemn fillet saw the scorn 






song 


you know the old hidalgo
 his box is next to ours 
who threw the prima donna
the wreath of orange-flowers 
he owns the half of aragon 
with mines beyond the main 
a very ancient nobleman 
and gentleman of spain 

they swear that i must wed him 
in spite of yea or nay 
though uglier than the scaramouch 
the spectre in the play 
but i will sooner die a maid
than wear a gilded chain 
for all the ancient noblemen
and gentlemen of spain

aladdin 


when i was a beggarly boy 
and lived in a cellar damp 
i had not a friend nor a toy 
but i had aladdin's lamp 
when i could not sleep for cold 
i had fire enough in my brain 
and builded with roofs of gold 
my beautiful castles in spain 

since then i have toiled day and night 
i have money and power good store 
but i'd give all my lamps of silver bright 
for the one that is mine no more 
take fortune whatever you choose --
you gave and may snatch again 
i have nothing 'twould pain me to lose 
for i own no more castles in spain 






the flight of youth 


there are gains for all our losses 
there are balms for all our pain 
but when youth the dream departs 
it takes something from our hearts 
and it never comes again 

we are stronger and are better 
under manhood's sterner reign 
still we feel that something sweet
followed youth with flying feet 
and will never come again 

something beautiful is vanished 
and we sigh for it in vain 
we behold it everywhere 
on the earth and in the air 
but it never comes again

my playmate 


the pines were dark on ramoth hill 
their song was soft and low 
the blossoms in the sweet may wind
were falling like the snow 

the blossoms drifted at our feet 
the orchard birds sang clear 
the sweetest and the saddest day
it seemed of all the year 

for more to me than birds or flowers 
my playmate left her home 
and took with her the laughing spring 
the music and the bloom 

she kissed the lips of kith and kin 
she laid her hand in mine 
what more could ask the bashful boy
who fed her father's kine 

she left us in the bloom of may 
the constant years told o'er
their seasons with as sweet may morns 
but she came back no more 

i walk with noiseless feet the round
of uneventful years 
still o'er and o'er i sow the spring
and reap the autumn ears 

she lives where all the golden year
her summer roses blow 
the dusky children of the sun
before her come and go 

there haply with her jewelled hands
she smooths her silken gown --
no more the homespun lap wherein
i shook the walnuts down 

the wild grapes wait us by the brook 
the brown nuts on the hill 
and still the may-day flowers make sweet
the woods of follymill 

the lilies blossom in the pond 
the bird builds in the tree 
the dark pines sing on ramoth hill
the slow song of the sea 

i wonder if she thinks of them 
and how the old time seems 
if ever the pines of ramoth wood
are sounding in her dreams 

i see her face i hear her voice 
does she remember mine 
and what to her is now the boy
who fed her father's kine 

what cares she that the orioles build
for other eyes than ours --
that other hands with nuts are filled 
and other laps with flowers 

o playmate in the golden time 
our mossy seat is green 
its fringing violets blossom yet 
the old trees o'er it lean 

the winds so sweet with birch and fern
a sweeter memory blow 
and there in spring the veeries sing
the song of long ago 

and still the pines of ramoth wood
are moaning like the sea --
the moaning of the sea of change
between myself and thee 






the fire of driftwood 




we sat within the farmhouse old 
whose windows looking o'er the bay 
gave to the sea-breeze damp and cold 
an easy entrance night and day 

not far away we saw the port 
the strange old-fashioned silent town 
the lighthouse the dismantled fort 
the wooden houses quaint and brown 

we sat and talked until the night 
descending filled the little room 
our faces faded from the sight 
our voices only broke the gloom 

we spake of many a vanished scene 
of what we once had thought and said 
of what had been and might have been 
and who was changed and who was dead 

and all that fills the hearts of friends 
when first they feel with secret pain 
their lives thenceforth have separate ends 
and never can be one again 

the first slight swerving of the heart 
that words are powerless to express 
and leave it still unsaid in part 
or say it in too great excess 

the very tones in which we spake
had something strange i could but mark 
the leaves of memory seemed to make
a mournful rustling in the dark 

oft died the words upon our lips 
as suddenly from out the fire
built of the wreck of stranded ships 
the flames would leap and then expire 

and as their splendor flashed and failed 
we thought of wrecks upon the main 
of ships dismasted that were hailed
and sent no answer back again 

the windows rattling in their frames 
the ocean roaring up the beach 
the gusty blast the bickering flames 
all mingled vaguely in our speech 

until they made themselves a part
of fancies floating through the brain 
the long-lost ventures of the heart 
that send no answers back again 

o flames that glowed o hearts that yearned 
they were indeed too much akin 
the driftwood fire without that burned 
the thoughts that burned and glowed within 






a death-bed 


her suffering ended with the day 
yet lived she at its close 
and breathed the long long night away
in statue-like repose 

but when the sun in all his state
illumed the eastern skies 
she passed through glory's morning gate
and walked in paradise 






telling the bees 


here is the place right over the hill
runs the path i took 
you can see the gap in the old wall still 
and the stepping-stones in the shallow brook 

there is the house with the gate red-barred 
and the poplars tall 
and the barn's brown length and the cattle-yard 
and the white horns tossing above the wall 

there are the beehives ranged in the sun 
and down by the brink
of the brook are her poor flowers weed-o'errun --
pansy and daffodil rose and pink 

a year has gone as the tortoise goes 
heavy and slow 
and the same rose blows and the same sun glows 
and the same brook sings of a year ago 

there's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze 
and the june sun warm
tangles his wings of fire in the trees 
setting as then over fernside farm 

i mind me how with a lover's care
from my sunday coat
i brushed off the burrs and smoothed my hair 
and cooled at the brookside my brow and throat 

since we parted a month had passed --
to love a year 
down through the beeches i looked at last
on the little red gate and the well-sweep near 

i can see it all now --the slantwise rain
of light through the leaves 
the sundown's blaze on her window-pane 
the bloom of her roses under the eaves 

just the same as a month before --
the house and the trees 
the barn's brown gable the vine by the door --
nothing changed but the hives of bees 

before them under the garden wall 
forward and back 
went drearily singing the chore-girl small 
draping each hive with a shred of black 

trembling i listened the summer sun
had the chill of snow 
for i knew she was telling the bees of one
gone on the journey we all must go 

then i said to myself my mary weeps
for the dead to-day 
haply her blind old grandsire sleeps
the fret and the pain of his age away 

but her dog whined low on the doorway sill 
with his cane to his chin 
the old man sat and the chore-girl still
sung to the bees stealing out and in 

and the song she was singing ever since
in my ear sounds on 
 stay at home pretty bees fly not hence 
mistress mary is dead and gone 






katie 


it may be through some foreign grace 
and unfamiliar charm of face 
it may be that across the foam
which bore her from her childhood's home 
by some strange spell my katie brought
along with english creeds and thought--
entangled in her golden hair--
some english sunshine warmth and air 
i cannot tell --but here to-day 
a thousand billowy leagues away
from that green isle whose twilight skies
no darker are than katie's eyes 
she seems to me go where she will 
an english girl in england still 

i meet her on the dusty street 
and daisies spring about her feet 
or touched to life beneath her tread 
an english cowslip lifts its head 
and as to do her grace rise up
the primrose and the buttercup 
i roam with her through fields of cane 
and seem to stroll an english lane 
which white with blossoms of the may 
spreads its green carpet in her way 
as fancy wills the path beneath
is golden gorse or purple heath 
and now we hear in woodlands dim
their unarticulated hymn 
now walk through rippling waves of wheat 
now sink in mats of clover sweet 
or see before us from the lawn
the lark go up to greet the dawn 
all birds that love the english sky
throng round my path when she is by 
the blackbird from a neighboring thorn
with music brims the cup of morn 
and in a thick melodious rain
the mavis pours her mellow strain 
but only when my katie's voice
makes all the listening woods rejoice
i hear--with cheeks that flush and pale--
the passion of the nightingale 






my love 


not as all other women are
is she that to my soul is dear 
her glorious fancies come from far 
beneath the silver evening-star 
and yet her heart is ever near 

great feelings hath she of her own 
which lesser souls may never know 
god giveth them to her alone 
and sweet they are as any tone
wherewith the wind may choose to blow 

yet in herself she dwelleth not 
although no home were half so fair 
no simplest duty is forgot 
life hath no dim and lowly spot
that doth not in her sunshine share 

she doeth little kindnesses 
which most leave undone or despise 
for naught that sets one heart at ease 
and giveth happiness or peace 
is low-esteem d in her eyes 

she hath no scorn of common things 
and though she seem of other birth 
round us her heart intwines and clings 
and patiently she folds her wings
to tread the humble paths of earth 

blessing she is god made her so 
and deeds of week-day holiness
fall from her noiseless as the snow 
nor hath she ever chanced to know
that aught were easier than to bless 

she is most fair and thereunto
her life doth rightly harmonize 
feeling or thought that was not true
ne'er made less beautiful the blue
unclouded heaven of her eyes 

she is a woman one in whom
the spring-time of her childish years
hath never lost its fresh perfume 
though knowing well that life hath room
for many blights and many tears 

i love her with a love as still
as a broad river's peaceful might 
which by high tower and lowly mill 
goes wandering at its own will 
and yet doth ever flow aright 

and on its full deep breast serene 
like quiet isles my duties lie 
it flows around them and between 
and makes them fresh and fair and green 
sweet homes wherein to live and die 






she came and went 


as a twig trembles which a bird
lights on to sing then leaves unbent 
so is my memory thrilled and stirred --
i only know she came and went 

as clasps some lake by gusts unriven 
the blue dome's measureless content 
so my soul held that moment's heaven --
i only know she came and went 

as at one bound our swift spring heaps
the orchards full of bloom and scent 
so clove her may my wintry sleeps --
i only know she came and went 

an angel stood and met my gaze 
through the low doorway of my tent 
the tent is struck the vision stays --
i only know she came and went 

oh when the room grows slowly dim 
and life's last oil is nearly spent 
one gush of light these eyes will brim 
only to think she came and went 






her epitaph 


the handful here that once was mary's earth 
held while it breathed so beautiful a soul 
that when she died all recognized her birth 
and had their sorrow in serene control 

 not here not here to every mourner's heart
the wintry wind seemed whispering round her bier 
and when the tomb-door opened with a start
we heard it echoed from within -- not here 

shouldst thou sad pilgrim who mayst hither pass 
note in these flowers a delicater hue 
should spring come earlier to this hallowed grass 
or the bee later linger on the dew --

know that her spirit to her body lent
such sweetness grace as only goodness can 
that even her dust and this her monument 
have yet a spell to stay one lonely man 
lonely through life but looking for the day
when what is mortal of himself shall sleep 
when human passion shall have passed away 
and love no longer be a thing to weep 






apart 


at sea are tossing ships 
on shore are dreaming shells 
and the waiting heart and the loving lips 
blossoms and bridal bells 

at sea are sails a-gleam 
on shore are longing eyes 
and the far horizon's haunting dream
of ships that sail the skies 

at sea are masts that rise
like spectres from the deep 
on shore are the ghosts of drowning cries
that cross the waves of sleep 

at sea are wrecks a-strand 
on shore are shells that moan 
old anchors buried in barren sand 
sea-mist and dreams alone 






the discoverer 


i have a little kinsman
whose earthly summers are but three 
and yet a voyager is he
greater than drake or frobisher 
than all their peers together 
he is a brave discoverer 
and far beyond the tether
of them who seek the frozen pole 
has sailed where the noiseless surges roll 
ay he has travelled whither
a winged pilot steered his bark
through the portals of the dark 
past hoary mimir's well and tree 
across the unknown sea 

suddenly in his fair young hour 
came one who bore a flower 
and laid it in his dimpled hand
with this command 
 henceforth thou art a rover 
thou must make a voyage far 
sail beneath the evening star 
and a wondrous land discover 
--with his sweet smile innocent
our little kinsman went 

since that time no word
from the absent has been heard 
who can tell
how he fares or answer well
what the little one has found
since he left us outward bound 
would that he might return 
then should we learn
from the pricking of his chart
how the skyey roadways part 
hush does not the baby this way bring 
to lay beside this severed curl 
some starry offering
of chrysolite or pearl 

ah no not so 
we may follow on his track 
but he comes not back 
and yet i dare aver
he is a brave discoverer
of climes his elders do not know 
he has more learning than appears
on the scroll of twice three thousand years 
more than in the groves is taught 
or from furthest indies brought 
he knows perchance how spirits fare --
what shapes the angels wear 
what is their guise and speech
in those lands beyond our reach --
and his eyes behold
things that shall never never be to mortal hearers told 






at last 


when first the bride and bridegroom wed 
they love their single selves the best 
a sword is in the marriage bed 
their separate slumbers are not rest 
they quarrel and make up again 
they give and suffer worlds of pain 
both right and wrong 
they struggle long 
till some good day when they are old 
some dark day when the bells are tolled 
death having taken their best of life 
they lose themselves and find each other 
they know that they are husband wife 
for weeping they are father mother

 thalatta 




i stand upon the summit of my years 
behind the toil the camp the march the strife 
the wandering and the desert vast afar 
beyond this weary way behold the sea 
the sea o'erswept by clouds and winds and wings 
by thoughts and wishes manifold whose breath
is freshness and whose mighty pulse is peace 
palter no question of the dim beyond 
cut loose the bark such voyage itself is rest 
majestic motion unimpeded scope 
a widening heaven a current without care 
eternity --deliverance promise course 
time-tired souls salute thee from the shore 






gondolieds 







dear yesterday glide not so fast 
oh let me cling
to thy white garments floating past 
even to shadows which they cast
i cling i cling 
show me thy face
just once once more a single night
cannot have brought a loss a blight
upon its grace 

nor are they dead whom thou dost bear 
robed for the grave 
see what a smile their red lips wear 
to lay them living wilt thou dare
into a grave 
i know i know 
i left thee first now i repent 
i listen now i never meant
to have thee go 

just once once more tell me the word
thou hadst for me 
alas although my heart was stirred 
i never fully knew or heard
it was for me 
o yesterday 
my yesterday thy sorest pain
were joy couldst thou but come again --
sweet yesterday 

 venice may 






all red with joy the waiting west 
o little swallow 
couldst thou tell me which road is best 
cleaving high air with thy soft breast
for keel o swallow 
thou must o'erlook
my seas and know if i mistake 
i would not the same harbor make
which yesterday forsook 

i hear the swift blades dip and plash
of unseen rowers 
on unknown land the waters dash 
who knows how it be wise or rash
to meet the rowers 
prem prem 
venetia's boatmen lean and cry 
with voiceless lips i drift and lie
upon the twilight sea 

the swallow sleeps her last low call
had sound of warning 
sweet little one whate'er befall 
thou wilt not know that it was all
in vain thy warning 
i may not borrow
a hope a help i close my eyes 
cold wind blows from the bridge of sighs 
kneeling i wait to-morrow 

 venice may 






in the twilight 


men say the sullen instrument
that from the master's bow 
with pangs of joy or woe 
feels music's soul through every fibre sent 
whispers the ravished strings
more than he knew or meant 
old summers in its memory glow 
the secrets of the wind it sings 
it hears the april-loosened springs 
and mixes with its mood
all it dreamed when it stood
in the murmurous pine-wood
long ago 

the magical moonlight then
steeped every bough and cone 
the roar of the brook in the glen
came dim from the distance blown 
the wind through its glooms sang low 
and it swayed to and fro
with delight as it stood 
in the wonderful wood 
long ago 

o my life have we not had seasons
that only said live and rejoice 
that asked not for causes and reasons 
but made us all feeling and voice 
when we went with the winds in their blowing 
when nature and we were peers 
and we seemed to share in the flowing
of the inexhaustible years 
have we not from the earth drawn juices
too fine for earth's sordid uses 
have i heard have i seen
all i feel and i know 
doth my heart overween 
or could it have been
long ago 

sometimes a breath floats by me 
an odor from dreamland sent 
that makes the ghost seem nigh me
of a splendor that came and went 
of a life lived somewhere i know not
in what diviner sphere 
of memories that stay not and go not 
like music heard once by an ear
that cannot forget or reclaim it 
a something so shy it would shame it
to make it a show 
a something too vague could i name it 
for others to know 
as if i had lived it or dreamed it 
as if i had acted or schemed it 
long ago 

and yet could i live it over 
this life that stirs in my brain 
could i be both maiden and lover 
moon and tide bee and clover 
as i seem to have been once again 
could i but speak and show it 
this pleasure more sharp than pain 
that baffles and lures me so 
the world should not lack a poet 
such as it had
in the ages glad 
long ago 






the tide rises the tide falls 


the tide rises the tide falls 
the twilight darkens the curlew calls 
along the sea-sands damp and brown
the traveller hastens toward the town 
and the tide rises the tide falls 

darkness settles on roofs and walls 
but the sea in the darkness calls and calls 
the little waves with their soft white hands 
efface the footprints in the sands 
and the tide rises the tide falls 

the morning breaks the steeds in their stalls
stamp and neigh as the hostler calls 
the day returns but nevermore
returns the traveller to the shore 
and the tide rises the tide falls 






the fall of the leaf 


the evening of the year draws on 
the fields a later aspect wear 
since summer's garishness is gone 
some grains of night tincture the noontide air 

behold the shadows of the trees
now circle wider 'bout their stem 
like sentries that by slow degrees
perform their rounds gently protecting them 

and as the year doth decline 
the sun allows a scantier light 
behind each needle of the pine
there lurks a small auxiliar to the night 

i hear the cricket's slumbrous lay
around beneath me and on high 
it rocks the night it soothes the day 
and everywhere is nature's lullaby 

but most he chirps beneath the sod 
when he has made his winter bed 
his creak grown fainter but more broad 
a film of autumn o'er the summer spread 

small birds in fleets migrating by 
now beat across some meadow's bay 
and as they tack and veer on high 
with faint and hurried click beguile the way 

far in the woods these golden days 
some leaf obeys its maker's call 
and through their hollow aisles it plays
with delicate touch the prelude of the fall 

gently withdrawing from its stem 
it lightly lays itself along
where the same hand hath pillowed them 
resigned to sleep upon the old year's throng 

the loneliest birch is brown and sere 
the furthest pool is strewn with leaves 
which float upon their watery bier 
where is no eye that sees no heart that grieves 

the jay screams through the chestnut wood 
the crisped and yellow leaves around
are hue and texture of my mood --
and these rough burrs my heirlooms on the ground 

the threadbare trees so poor and thin --
they are no wealthier than i 
but with as brave a core within
they rear their boughs to the october sky 

poor knights they are which bravely wait
the charge of winter's cavalry 
keeping a simple roman state 
discumbered of their persian luxury 






the rhodora 




in may when sea-winds pierced our solitudes 
i found the fresh rhodora in the woods 
spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook 
to please the desert and the sluggish brook 
the purple petals fallen in the pool 
made the black water with their beauty gay 
here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool 
and court the flower that cheapens his array 
rhodora if the sages ask thee why
this charm is wasted on the earth and sky 
tell them dear that if eyes were made for seeing 
then beauty is its own excuse for being 
why thou wert there o rival of the rose 
i never thought to ask i never knew 
but in my simple ignorance suppose
the self-same power that brought me there brought you 






nature 


o nature i do not aspire
to be the highest in thy quire --
to be a meteor in the sky 
or comet that may range on high 
only a zephyr that may blow
among the reeds by the river low 
give me thy most privy place
where to run my airy race 

in some withdrawn unpublic mead
let me sigh upon a reed 
or in the woods with leafy din 
whisper the still evening in 
some still work give me to do --
only--be it near to you 
for i'd rather be thy child
and pupil in the forest wild 
than be the king of men elsewhere 
and most sovereign slave of care 






my strawberry 


o marvel fruit of fruits i pause
to reckon thee i ask what cause
set free so much of red from heats
at core of earth and mixed such sweets
with sour and spice what was that strength
which out of darkness length by length 
spun all thy shining thread of vine 
netting the fields in bond as thine 
i see thy tendrils drink by sips
from grass and clover's smiling lips 
i hear thy roots dig down for wells 
tapping the meadow's hidden cells 
whole generations of green things 
descended from long lines of springs 
i see make room for thee to bide
a quiet comrade by their side 
i see the creeping peoples go
mysterious journeys to and fro 
treading to right and left of thee 
doing thee homage wonderingly 
i see the wild bees as they fare 
thy cups of honey drink but spare 
i mark thee bathe and bathe again
in sweet uncalendared spring rain 
i watch how all may has of sun
makes haste to have thy ripeness done 
while all her nights let dews escape
to set and cool thy perfect shape 
ah fruit of fruits no more i pause
to dream and seek thy hidden laws 
i stretch my hand and dare to taste 
in instant of delicious waste
on single feast all things that went
to make the empire thou hast spent 






the humble-bee 


burly dozing humble-bee 
where thou art is clime for me 
let them sail for porto rique 
far-off heats through seas to seek 
i will follow thee alone 
thou animated torrid-zone 
zigzag steerer desert cheerer 
let me chase thy waving lines 
keep me nearer me thy hearer 
singing over shrubs and vines 

insect lover of the sun 
joy of thy dominion 
sailor of the atmosphere 
swimmer through the waves of air 
voyager of light and noon 
epicurean of june 
wait i prithee till i come
within earshot of thy hum --
all without is martyrdom 

when the south wind in may days 
with a net of shining haze
silvers the horizon wall 
and with softness touching all 
tints the human countenance
with a color of romance 
and infusing subtle heats 
turns the sod to violets 
thou in sunny solitudes 
rover of the underwoods 
the green silence dost displace
with thy mellow breezy bass 

hot midsummer's petted crone 
sweet to me thy drowsy tone
tells of countless sunny hours 
long days and solid banks of flowers 
of gulfs of sweetness without bound
in indian wildernesses found 
of syrian peace immortal leisure 
firmest cheer and bird-like pleasure 

aught unsavory or unclean
hath my insect never seen 
but violets and bilberry bells 
maple-sap and daffodels 
grass with green flag half-mast high 
succory to match the sky 
columbine with horn of honey 
scented fern and agrimony 
clover catchfly adder's-tongue 
and brier-roses dwelt among 
all beside was unknown waste 
all was picture as he passed 

wiser far than human seer 
yellow-breeched philosopher 
seeing only what is fair 
sipping only what is sweet 
thou dost mock at fate and care 
leave the chaff and take the wheat 
when the fierce northwestern blast
cools sea and land so far and fast 
thou already slumberest deep 
woe and want thou canst outsleep 
want and woe which torture us 
thy sleep makes ridiculous 






the summer rain 


my books i'd fain cast off i cannot read 
'twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large
down in the meadow where is richer feed 
and will not mind to hit their proper targe 

plutarch was good and so was homer too 
our shakespeare's life were rich to live again 
what plutarch read that was not good nor true 
nor shakespeare's books unless his books were men 

here while i lie beneath this walnut bough 
what care i for the greeks or for troy town 
if juster battles are enacted now
between the ants upon this hummock's crown 

bid homer wait till i the issue learn 
if red or black the gods will favor most 
or yonder ajax will the phalanx turn 
struggling to heave some rock against the host 

tell shakespeare to attend some leisure hour 
for now i've business with this drop of dew 
and see you not the clouds prepare a shower --
i'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue 

this bed of herdsgrass and wild oats was spread
last year with nicer skill than monarchs use 
a clover tuft is pillow for my head 
and violets quite overtop my shoes 

and now the cordial clouds have shut all in 
and gently swells the wind to say all's well 
the scattered drops are falling fast and thin 
some in the pool some in the flower-bell 

i am well drenched upon my bed of oats 
but see that globe come rolling down its stem 
now like a lonely planet there it floats 
and now it sinks into my garment's hem 

drip drip the trees for all the country round 
and richness rare distills from every bough 
the wind alone it is makes every sound 
shaking down crystals on the leaves below 

for shame the sun will never show himself 
who could not with his beams e'er melt me so 
my dripping locks --they would become an elf 
who in a beaded coat does gayly go 






to the dandelion 


dear common flower that grow'st beside the way 
fringing the dusty road with harmless gold 
first pledge of blithesome may 
which children pluck and full of pride uphold 
high-hearted buccaneers o'erjoyed that they
an eldorado in the grass have found 
which not the rich earth's ample round
may match in wealth thou art more dear to me
than all the prouder summer-blooms may be 

gold such as thine ne'er drew the spanish prow
through the primeval hush of indian seas 
nor wrinkled the lean brow
of age to rob the lover's heart of ease 
'tis the spring's largess which she scatters now
to rich and poor alike with lavish hand 
though most hearts never understand
to take it at god's value but pass by
the offered wealth with unrewarded eye 

thou art my tropics and mine italy 
to look at thee unlocks a warmer clime 
the eyes thou givest me
are in the heart and heed not space or time 
not in mid june the golden-cuirassed bee
feels a more summer-like warm ravishment
in the white lily's breezy tent 
his fragrant sybaris than i when first
from the dark green thy yellow circles burst 

then think i of deep shadows on the grass 
of meadows where in sun the cattle graze 
where as the breezes pass 
the gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways 
of leaves that slumber in a cloudy mass 
or whiten in the wind of waters blue
that from the distance sparkle through
some woodland gap and of a sky above 
where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move 

my childhood's earliest thoughts are linked with thee 
the sight of thee calls back the robin's song 
who from the dark old tree
beside the door sang clearly all day long 
and i secure in childish piety 
listened as if i heard an angel sing
with news from heaven which he could bring
fresh every day to my untainted ears
when birds and flowers and i were happy peers 

how like a prodigal doth nature seem 
when thou for all thy gold so common art 
thou teachest me to deem
more sacredly of every human heart 
since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam
of heaven and could some wondrous secret show 
did we but pay the love we owe 
and with a child's undoubting wisdom look
on all these living pages of god's book 






the chambered nautilus 


this is the ship of pearl which poets feign 
sails the unshadowed main --
the venturous bark that flings
on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
in gulfs enchanted where the siren sings 
and coral reefs lie bare 
where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair 

its webs of living gauze no more unfurl 
wrecked is the ship of pearl 
and every chambered cell 
where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell 
as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell 
before thee lies revealed --
its irised ceiling rent its sunless crypt unsealed 

year after year beheld the silent toil
that spread his lustrous coil 
still as the spiral grew 
he left the past year's dwelling for the new 
stole with soft step its shining archway through 
built up its idle door 
stretched in his last-found home and knew the old no more 

thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee 
child of the wandering sea 
cast from her lap forlorn 
from thy dead lips a clearer note is born
than ever triton blew from wreath d horn 
while on mine ear it rings 
through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings 

build thee more stately mansions o my soul 
as the swift seasons roll 
leave thy low-vaulted past 
let each new temple nobler than the last 
shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast 
till thou at length art free 
leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea 






thought 


o messenger art thou the king or i 
thou dalliest outside the palace gate
till on thine idle armor lie the late
and heavy dews the morn's bright scornful eye
reminds thee then in subtle mockery 
thou smilest at the window where i wait 
who bade thee ride for life in empty state
my days go on while false hours prophesy
thy quick return at last in sad despair 
i cease to bid thee leave thee free as air 
when lo thou stand'st before me glad and fleet 
and lay'st undreamed-of treasures at my feet 
ah messenger thy royal blood to buy
i am too poor thou art the king not i 






stanzas 


thought is deeper than all speech 
feeling deeper than all thought 
souls to souls can never teach
what unto themselves was taught 

we are spirits clad in veils 
man by man was never seen 
all our deep communing fails
to remove the shadowy screen 

heart to heart was never known 
mind with mind did never meet 
we are columns left alone
of a temple once complete 

like the stars that gem the sky 
far apart though seeming near 
in our light we scattered lie 
all is thus but starlight here 

what is social company
but a babbling summer stream 
what our wise philosophy
but the glancing of a dream 

only when the sun of love
melts the scattered stars of thought 
only when we live above
what the dim-eyed world hath taught 

only when our souls are fed
by the fount which gave them birth 
and by inspiration led 
which they never drew from earth 

we like parted drops of rain
swelling till they meet and run 
shall be all absorbed again 
melting flowing into one 






coronation 


at the king's gate the subtle noon
wove filmy yellow nets of sun 
into the drowsy snare too soon
the guards fell one by one 

through the king's gate unquestioned then 
a beggar went and laughed this brings
me chance at last to see if men
fare better being kings 

the king sat bowed beneath his crown 
propping his face with listless hand 
watching the hour-glass sifting down
too slow its shining sand 

 poor man what wouldst thou have of me 
the beggar turned and pitying 
replied like one in dream of thee 
nothing i want the king 

uprose the king and from his head
shook off the crown and threw it by 
 o man thou must have known he said 
 a greater king than i 

through all the gates unquestioned then 
went king and beggar hand in hand 
whispered the king shall i know when
before his throne i stand 

the beggar laughed free winds in haste
were wiping from the king's hot brow
the crimson lines the crown had traced 
 this is his presence now 

at the king's gate the crafty noon
unwove its yellow nets of sun 
out of their sleep in terror soon
the guards waked one by one 

 ho here ho there has no man seen
the king the cry ran to and fro 
beggar and king they laughed i ween 
the laugh that free men know 

on the king's gate the moss grew gray 
the king came not they called him dead 
and made his eldest son one day
slave in his father's stead 






on a bust of dante 


see from this counterfeit of him
whom arno shall remember long 
how stern of lineament how grim 
the father was of tuscan song 
there but the burning sense of wrong 
perpetual care and scorn abide 
small friendship for the lordly throng 
distrust of all the world beside 

faithful if this wan image be 
no dream his life was --but a fight 
could any beatrice see
a lover in that anchorite 
to that cold ghibelline's gloomy sight
who could have guessed the visions came
of beauty veiled with heavenly light 
in circles of eternal flame 

the lips as cum 's cavern close 
the cheeks with fast and sorrow thin 
the rigid front almost morose 
but for the patient hope within 
declare a life whose course hath been
unsullied still though still severe 
which through the wavering days of sin 
kept itself icy-chaste and clear 

not wholly such his haggard look
when wandering once forlorn he strayed 
with no companion save his book 
to corvo's hushed monastic shade 
where as the benedictine laid
his palm upon the convent's guest 
the single boon for which he prayed
was peace that pilgrim's one request 

peace dwells not here --this rugged face
betrays no spirit of repose 
the sullen warrior sole we trace 
the marble man of many woes 
such was his mien when first arose
the thought of that strange tale divine 
when hell he peopled with his foes 
the scourge of many a guilty line 

war to the last he waged with all
the tyrant canker-worms of earth 
baron and duke in hold and hall 
cursed the dark hour that gave him birth 
he used rome's harlot for his mirth 
plucked bare hypocrisy and crime 
but valiant souls of knightly worth
transmitted to the rolls of time 

o time whose verdicts mock our own 
the only righteous judge art thou 
that poor old exile sad and lone 
is latium's other virgil now 
before his name the nations bow 
his words are parcel of mankind 
deep in whose hearts as on his brow 
the marks have sunk of dante's mind 






pan in wall street 




just where the treasury's marble front
looks over wall street's mingled nations 
where jews and gentiles most are wont
to throng for trade and last quotations 
where hour by hour the rates of gold
outrival in the ears of people 
the quarter-chimes serenely tolled
from trinity's undaunted steeple --

even there i heard a strange wild strain
sound high above the modern clamor 
above the cries of greed and gain 
the curbstone war the auction's hammer 
and swift on music's misty ways 
it led from all this strife for millions 
to ancient sweet-do-nothing days
among the kirtle-robed sicilians 

and as it stilled the multitude 
and yet more joyous rose and shriller 
i saw the minstrel where he stood
at ease against a doric pillar 
one hand a droning organ played 
the other held a pan's-pipe fashioned
like those of old to lips that made
the reeds give out that strain impassioned 

'twas pan himself had wandered here
a-strolling through this sordid city 
and piping to the civic ear
the prelude of some pastoral ditty 
the demigod had crossed the seas --
from haunts of shepherd nymph and satyr 
and syracusan times --to these
far shores and twenty centuries later 

a ragged cap was on his head 
but--hidden thus--there was no doubting
that all with crispy locks o'erspread 
his gnarl d horns were somewhere sprouting 
his club-feet cased in rusty shoes 
were crossed as on some frieze you see them 
and trousers patched of divers hues 
concealed his crooked shanks beneath them 

he filled the quivering reeds with sound 
and o'er his mouth their changes shifted 
and with his goat's-eyes looked around
where'er the passing current drifted 
and soon as on trinacrian hills
the nymphs and herdsmen ran to hear him 
even now the tradesmen from their tills 
with clerks and porters crowded near him 

the bulls and bears together drew
from jauncey court and new street alley 
as erst if pastorals be true 
came beasts from every wooded valley 
the random passers stayed to list --
a boxer gon rough and merry 
a broadway daphnis on his tryst
with nais at the brooklyn ferry 

a one-eyed cyclops halted long
in tattered cloak of army pattern 
and galatea joined the throng --
a blowsy apple-vending slattern 
while old silenus staggered out
from some new-fangled lunch-house handy 
and bade the piper with a shout 
to strike up yankee doodle dandy 

a newsboy and a peanut-girl
like little fauns began to caper 
his hair was all in tangled curl 
her tawny legs were bare and taper 
and still the gathering larger grew 
and gave its pence and crowded nigher 
while aye the shepherd-minstrel blew
his pipe and struck the gamut higher 

o heart of nature beating still
with throbs her vernal passion taught her --
even here as on the vine-clad hill 
or by the arethusan water 
new forms may fold the speech new lands
arise within these ocean-portals 
but music waves eternal wands --
enchantress of the souls of mortals 

so thought i --but among us trod
a man in blue with legal baton 
and scoffed the vagrant demigod 
and pushed him from the step i sat on 
doubting i mused upon the cry 
 great pan is dead --and all the people
went on their ways --and clear and high
the quarter sounded from the steeple 






auspex 


my heart i cannot still it 
nest that had song-birds in it 
and when the last shall go 
the dreary days to fill it 
instead of lark or linnet 
shall whirl dead leaves and snow 

had they been swallows only 
without the passion stronger
that skyward longs and sings --
woe's me i shall be lonely
when i can feel no longer
the impatience of their wings 

a moment sweet delusion 
like birds the brown leaves hover 
but it will not be long
before their wild confusion
fall wavering down to cover
the poet and his song 






birds 


birds are singing round my window 
tunes the sweetest ever heard 
and i hang my cage there daily 
but i never catch a bird 

so with thoughts my brain is peopled 
and they sing there all day long 
but they will not fold their pinions
in the little cage of song

toujours amour 


prithee tell me dimple-chin 
at what age does love begin 
your blue eyes have scarcely seen
summers three my fairy queen 
but a miracle of sweets 
soft approaches sly retreats 
show the little archer there 
hidden in your pretty hair 
when didst learn a heart to win 
prithee tell me dimple-chin 

 oh the rosy lips reply 
 i can't tell you if i try 
'tis so long i can't remember 
ask some younger lass than i 

tell oh tell me grizzled-face 
do your heart and head keep pace 
when does hoary love expire 
when do frosts put out the fire 
can its embers burn below
all that chill december snow 
care you still soft hands to press 
bonny heads to smooth and bless 
when does love give up the chase 
tell oh tell me grizzled-face 

 ah the wise old lips reply 
 youth may pass and strength may die 
but of love i can't foretoken 
ask some older sage than i 






a sigh 


it was nothing but a rose i gave her --
nothing but a rose
any wind might rob of half its savor 
any wind that blows 

when she took it from my trembling fingers
with a hand as chill --
ah the flying touch upon them lingers 
stays and thrills them still 

withered faded pressed between the pages 
crumpled fold on fold --
once it lay upon her breast and ages
cannot make it old 






no more 


this is the burden of the heart 
the burden that it always bore 
we live to love we meet to part 
and part to meet on earth no more 
we clasp each other to the heart 
and part to meet on earth no more 

there is a time for tears to start --
for dews to fall and larks to soar 
the time for tears is when we part
to meet upon the earth no more 
the time for tears is when we part
to meet on this wide earth--no more 






to a young girl dying 




this is palm sunday mindful of the day 
i bring palm branches found upon my way 
but these will wither thine shall never die --
the sacred palms thou bearest to the sky 
dear little saint though but a child in years 
older in wisdom than my gray compeers 
 we doubt and tremble -- we with bated breath 
talk of this mystery of life and death 
thou strong in faith art gifted to conceive
beyond thy years and teach us to believe 

then take my palms triumphal to thy home 
gentle white palmer never more to roam 
only sweet sister give me ere thou go'st 
thy benediction --for my love thou know'st 
we too are pilgrims travelling towards the shrine 
pray that our pilgrimage may end like thine 






the port of ships 


behind him lay the gray azores 
behind the gates of hercules 
before him not the ghost of shores 
before him only shoreless seas 
the good mate said now must we pray 
for lo the very stars are gone 
brave adm'ral speak --what shall i say 
 why say 'sail on sail on and on ' 

 my men grow mutinous day by day 
my men grow ghastly wan and weak 
the stout mate thought of home a spray
of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek 
 what shall i say brave adm'ral say 
if we sight naught but seas at dawn 
 why you shall say at break of day 
'sail on sail on sail on and on ' 

they sailed and sailed as winds might blow 
until at last the blanched mate said 
 why now not even god would know
should i and all my men fall dead 
these very winds forget their way 
for god from these dread seas is gone 
now speak brave adm'ral speak and say-- 
he said sail on sail on and on 

they sailed they sailed then spake the mate 
 this mad sea shows its teeth to-night 
he curls his lip he lies in wait
with lifted teeth as if to bite 
brave adm'ral say but one good word --
what shall we do when hope is gone 
the words leaped as a leaping sword 
 sail on sail on sail on and on 





 from the complete poetical works of joaquin miller 




paradisi gloria 


there is a city builded by no hand 
and unapproachable by sea or shore 
and unassailable by any band
of storming soldiery for evermore 

there we no longer shall divide our time
by acts or pleasures --doing petty things
of work or warfare merchandise or rhyme 
but we shall sit beside the silver springs

that flow from god's own footstool and behold
sages and martyrs and those blessed few
who loved us once and were beloved of old 
to dwell with them and walk with them anew 

in alternations of sublime repose 
musical motion the perpetual play
of every faculty that heaven bestows
through the bright busy and eternal day 






ballad 


in the summer even 
while yet the dew was hoar 
i went plucking purple pansies 
till my love should come to shore 
the fishing-lights their dances
were keeping out at sea 
and come i sung my true love 
come hasten home to me 

but the sea it fell a-moaning 
and the white gulls rocked thereon 
and the young moon dropped from heaven 
and the lights hid one by one 
all silently their glances
slipped down the cruel sea 
and wait cried the night and wind and storm --
wait till i come to thee 












the fool's prayer 


the royal feast was done the king
sought some new sport to banish care 
and to his jester cried sir fool 
kneel now and make for us a prayer 

the jester doffed his cap and bells 
and stood the mocking court before 
they could not see the bitter smile
behind the painted grin he wore 

he bowed his head and bent his knee
upon the monarch's silken stool 
his pleading voice arose o lord 
be merciful to me a fool 

 no pity lord could change the heart
from red with wrong to white as wool 
the rod must heal the sin but lord 
be merciful to me a fool 

 'tis not by guilt the onward sweep
of truth and right o lord we stay 
'tis by our follies that so long
we hold the earth from heaven away 

 these clumsy feet still in the mire 
go crushing blossoms without end 
these hard well-meaning hands we thrust
among the heart-strings of a friend 

 the ill-timed truth we might have kept--
who knows how sharp it pierced and stung 
the word we had not sense to say--
who knows how grandly it had rung 

 our faults no tenderness should ask 
the chastening stripes must cleanse them all 
but for our blunders--oh in shame
before the eyes of heaven we fall 

 earth bears no balsam for mistakes 
men crown the knave and scourge the tool
that did his will but thou o lord 
be merciful to me a fool 

the room was hushed in silence rose
the king and sought his gardens cool 
and walked apart and murmured low 
 be merciful to me a fool 






on the life-mask of abraham lincoln 


this bronze doth keep the very form and mold
of our great martyr's face yes this is he 
that brow all wisdom all benignity 
that human humorous mouth those cheeks that hold
like some harsh landscape all the summer's gold 
that spirit fit for sorrow as the sea
for storms to beat on the lone agony
those silent patient lips too well foretold 
yes this is he who ruled a world of men
as might some prophet of the elder day --
brooding above the tempest and the fray
with deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken 
a power was his beyond the touch of art
or arm d strength his pure and mighty heart 






song 


years have flown since i knew thee first 
and i know thee as water is known of thirst 
yet i knew thee of old at the first sweet sight 
and thou art strange to me love to-night 






to a dead woman 


not a kiss in life but one kiss at life's end 
i have set on the face of death in trust for thee 
through long years keep it fresh on thy lips o friend 
at the gate of silence give it back to me

destiny 


three roses wan as moonlight and weighed down
each with its loveliness as with a crown 
drooped in a florist's window in a town 

the first a lover bought it lay at rest 
like flower on flower that night on beauty's breast 

the second rose as virginal and fair 
shrunk in the tangles of a harlot's hair 

the third a widow with new grief made wild 
shut in the icy palm of her dead child 






the kings 


a man said unto his angel 
 my spirits are fallen thro' 
and i cannot carry this battle 
o brother what shall i do 

 the terrible kings are on me 
with spears that are deadly bright 
against me so from the cradle
do fate and my fathers fight 

then said to the man his angel 
 thou wavering foolish soul 
back to the ranks what matter
to win or to lose the whole 

 as judged by the little judges
who hearken not well nor see 
not thus by the outer issue 
the wise shall interpret thee 

 thy will is the very the only 
the solemn event of things 
the weakest of hearts defying
is stronger than all these kings 

 tho' out of the past they gather 
mind's doubt and bodily pain 
and pallid thirst of the spirit
that is kin to the other twain 

 and grief in a cloud of banners 
and ringletted vain desires 
and vice with the spoils upon him
of thee and thy beaten sires 

 while kings of eternal evil
yet darken the hills about 
thy part is with broken sabre
to rise on the last redoubt 

 to fear not sensible failure 
nor covet the game at all 
but fighting fighting fighting 
die driven against the wall 






triumph 


the dawn came in through the bars of the blind --
and the winter's dawn is gray --
and said however you cheat your mind 
the hours are flying away 

a ghost of a dawn and pale and weak --
 has the sun a heart i said 
 to throw a morning flush on the cheek
whence a fairer flush has fled 

as a gray rose-leaf that is fading white
was the cheek where i set my kiss 
and on that side of the bed all night
death had watched and i on this 

i kissed her lips they were half apart 
yet they made no answering sign 
death's hand was on her failing heart 
and his eyes said she is mine 

i set my lips on the blue-veined lid 
half-veiled by her death-damp hair 
and oh for the violet depths it hid
and the light i longed for there 

faint day and the fainter life awoke 
and the night was overpast 
and i said though never in life you spoke
oh speak with a look at last 

for the space of a heart-beat fluttered her breath 
as a bird's wing spread to flee 
she turned her weary arms to death 
and the light of her eyes to me

evening song 


look off dear love across the sallow sands 
and mark yon meeting of the sun and sea 
how long they kiss in sight of all the lands 
ah longer longer we 

now in the sea's red vintage melts the sun 
as egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine 
and cleopatra night drinks all 'tis done 
love lay thine hand in mine 

come forth sweet stars and comfort heaven's heart 
glimmer ye waves round else unlighted sands 
o night divorce our sun and sky apart 
never our lips our hands

 the woods that bring the sunset near 


the wind from out the west is blowing 
the homeward-wandering cows are lowing 
dark grow the pine-woods dark and drear --
the woods that bring the sunset near 

when o'er wide seas the sun declines 
far off its fading glory shines 
far off sublime and full of fear --
the pine-woods bring the sunset near 

this house that looks to east to west 
this dear one is our home our rest 
yonder the stormy sea and here
the woods that bring the sunset near 






at night 


the sky is dark and dark the bay below
save where the midnight city's pallid glow
lies like a lily white
on the black pool of night 

o rushing steamer hurry on thy way
across the swirling kills and gusty bay 
to where the eddying tide
strikes hard the city's side 

for there between the river and the sea 
beneath that glow --the lily's heart to me --
a sleeping mother mild 
and by her breast a child 






 still in thy love i trust 


still in thy love i trust 
supreme o'er death since deathless is thy essence 
for putting off the dust 
thou hast but blest me with a nearer presence 

and so for this for all 
i breathe no selfish plaint no faithless chiding 
on me the snowflakes fall 
but thou hast gained a summer all-abiding 

striking a plaintive string 
like some poor harper at a palace portal 
i wait without and sing 
while those i love glide in and dwell immortal 






the future 


what may we take into the vast forever 
that marble door
admits no fruit of all our long endeavor 
no fame-wreathed crown we wore 
no garnered lore 

what can we bear beyond the unknown portal 
no gold no gains
of all our toiling in the life immortal
no hoarded wealth remains 
nor gilds nor stains 

naked from out that far abyss behind us
we entered here 
no word came with our coming to remind us
what wondrous world was near 
no hope no fear 

into the silent starless night before us 
naked we glide 
no hand has mapped the constellations o'er us 
no comrade at our side 
no chart no guide 

yet fearless toward that midnight black and hollow 
our footsteps fare 
the beckoning of a father's hand we follow--
his love alone is there 
no curse no care 






prescience 


the new moon hung in the sky 
the sun was low in the west 
and my betrothed and i
in the churchyard paused to rest--
happy maiden and lover 
dreaming the old dream over 
the light winds wandered by 
and robins chirped from the nest 

and lo in the meadow-sweet
was the grave of a little child 
with a crumbling stone at the feet 
and the ivy running wild--
tangled ivy and clover
folding it over and over 
close to my sweetheart's feet
was the little mound up-piled 

stricken with nameless fears 
she shrank and clung to me 
and her eyes were filled with tears
for a sorrow i did not see 
lightly the winds were blowing 
softly her tears were flowing--
tears for the unknown years
and a sorrow that was to be 






in august 


all the long august afternoon 
the little drowsy stream
whispers a melancholy tune 
as if it dreamed of june
and whispered in its dream 

the thistles show beyond the brook
dust on their down and bloom 
and out of many a weed-grown nook
the aster-flow rs look
with eyes of tender gloom 

the silent orchard aisles are sweet
with smell of ripening fruit 
through the sere grass in shy retreat 
flutter at coming feet 
the robins strange and mute 

there is no wind to stir the leaves 
the harsh leaves overhead 
only the querulous cricket grieves 
and shrilling locust weaves
a song of summer dead 






that day you came 


such special sweetness was about
that day god sent you here 
i knew the lavender was out 
and it was mid of year 

their common way the great winds blew 
the ships sailed out to sea 
yet ere that day was spent i knew
mine own had come to me 

as after song some snatch of tune
lurks still in grass or bough 
so somewhat of the end o' june
lurks in each weather now 

the young year sets the buds astir 
the old year strips the trees 
but ever in my lavender
i hear the brawling bees

a woman's thought 


i am a woman--therefore i may not
call to him cry to him 
fly to him 
bid him delay not 

and when he comes to me i must sit quiet 
still as a stone--
all silent and cold 
if my heart riot--
crush and defy it 
should i grow bold--
say one dear thing to him 
all my life fling to him 
cling to him--
what to atone
is enough for my sinning 
this were the cost to me 
this were my winning--
that he were lost to me 
not as a lover
at last if he part from me 
tearing my heart from me--
hurt beyond cure --
calm and demure
then must i hold me--
in myself fold me--
lest he discover 
showing no sign to him
by look of mine to him
what he has been to me--
how my heart turns to him 
follows him yearns to him 
prays him to love me 

pity me lean to me 
thou god above me 






the flight 


upon a cloud among the stars we stood 
the angel raised his hand and looked and said 
 which world of all yon starry myriad
shall we make wing to the still solitude
became a harp whereon his voice and mood
made spheral music round his haloed head 
i spake--for then i had not long been dead--
 let me look round upon the vasts and brood
a moment on these orbs ere i decide 
what is yon lower star that beauteous shines
and with soft splendor now incarnadines
our wings -- there would i go and there abide 
he smiled as one who some child's thought divines 
 that is the world where yesternight you died 






childhood 


old sorrow i shall meet again 
and joy perchance--but never never 
happy childhood shall we twain
see each other's face forever 

and yet i would not call thee back 
dear childhood lest the sight of me 
thine old companion on the rack
of age should sadden even thee 






little boy blue 


the little toy dog is covered with dust 
but sturdy and stanch he stands 
and the little toy soldier is red with rust 
and his musket moulds in his hands 
time was when the little toy dog was new
and the soldier was passing fair 
and that was the time when our little boy blue
kissed them and put them there 

 now don't you go till i come he said 
 and don't you make any noise 
so toddling off to his trundle-bed
he dreampt of the pretty toys 
and as he was dreaming an angel song
awakened our little boy blue --
oh the years are many the years are long 
but the little toy friends are true 

ay faithful to little boy blue they stand 
each in the same old place 
awaiting the touch of a little hand 
the smile of a little face 
and they wonder as waiting these long years through 
in the dust of that little chair 
what has become of our little boy blue
since he kissed them and put them there

strong as death 


o death when thou shalt come to me
from out thy dark where she is now 
come not with graveyard smell on thee 
or withered roses on thy brow 

come not o death with hollow tone 
and soundless step and clammy hand--
lo i am now no less alone
than in thy desolate doubtful land 

but with that sweet and subtle scent
that ever clung about her such
as with all things she brushed was blent 
and with her quick and tender touch 

with the dim gold that lit her hair 
crown thyself death let fall thy tread
so light that i may dream her there 
and turn upon my dying bed 

and through my chilling veins shall flame
my love as though beneath her breath 
and in her voice but call my name 
and i will follow thee o death

the white jessamine 


i knew she lay above me 
where the casement all the night
shone softened with a phosphor glow
of sympathetic light 
and that her fledgling spirit pure
was pluming fast for flight 

each tendril throbbed and quickened
as i nightly climbed apace 
and could scarce restrain the blossoms
when anear the destined place 
her gentle whisper thrilled me
ere i gazed upon her face 

i waited darkling till the dawn
should touch me into bloom 
while all my being panted
to outpour its first perfume 
when lo a paler flower than mine
had blossomed in the gloom 






the house of death 


not a hand has lifted the latchet
since she went out of the door--
no footstep shall cross the threshold 
since she can come in no more 

there is rust upon locks and hinges 
and mold and blight on the walls 
and silence faints in the chambers 
and darkness waits in the halls--

waits as all things have waited
since she went that day of spring 
borne in her pallid splendor
to dwell in the court of the king 

with lilies on brow and bosom 
with robes of silken sheen 
and her wonderful frozen beauty 
the lilies and silk between 

red roses she left behind her 
but they died long long ago
'twas the odorous ghost of a blossom
that seemed through the dusk to glow 

the garments she left mock the shadows
with hints of womanly grace 
and her image swims in the mirror
that was so used to her face 

the birds make insolent music
where the sunshine riots outside 
and the winds are merry and wanton
with the summer's pomp and pride 

but into this desolate mansion 
where love has closed the door 
nor sunshine nor summer shall enter 
since she can come in no more 






a tropical morning at sea 


sky in its lucent splendor lifted
higher than cloud can be 
air with no breath of earth to stain it 
pure on the perfect sea 

crests that touch and tilt each other 
jostling as they comb 
delicate crash of tinkling water 
broken in pearling foam 

plashings--or is it the pinewood's whispers 
babble of brooks unseen 
laughter of winds when they find the blossoms 
brushing aside the green 

waves that dip and dash and sparkle 
foam-wreaths slipping by 
soft as a snow of broken roses
afloat over mirrored sky 

off to the east the steady sun-track
golden meshes fill
webs of fire that lace and tangle 
never a moment still 

liquid palms but clap together 
fountains flower-like grow--
limpid bells on stems of silver--
out of a slope of snow 

sea-depths blue as the blue of violets--
blue as a summer sky 
when you blink at its arch sprung over
where in the grass you lie 

dimly an orange bit of rainbow
burns where the low west clears 
broken in air like a passionate promise
born of a moment's tears 

thinned to amber rimmed with silver 
clouds in the distance dwell 
clouds that are cool for all their color 
pure as a rose-lipped shell 

fleets of wool in the upper heavens
gossamer wings unfurl 
sailing so high they seem but sleeping
over yon bar of pearl 

what would the great world lose i wonder--
would it be missed or no--
if we stayed in the opal morning 
floating forever so 

swung to sleep by the swaying water 
only to dream all day--
blow salt wind from the north upstarting 
scatter such dreams away 






memory 


my mind lets go a thousand things 
like dates of wars and deaths of kings 
and yet recalls the very hour--
'twas noon by yonder village tower 
and on the last blue noon in may--
the wind came briskly up this way 
crisping the brook beside the road 
then pausing here set down its load
of pine-scents and shook listlessly
two petals from that wild-rose tree 






a mood 


a blight a gloom i know not what has crept upon my gladness--
some vague remote ancestral touch of sorrow or of madness 
a fear that is not fear a pain that has not pain's insistence 
a tense of longing or of loss in some foregone existence 
a subtle hurt that never pen has writ nor tongue has spoken--
such hurt perchance as nature feels when a blossomed bough is broken 






the way to arcady 


 oh what's the way to arcady 
 to arcady to arcady 
 oh what's the way to arcady 
 where all the leaves are merry 

oh what's the way to arcady 
the spring is rustling in the tree--
the tree the wind is blowing through--
it sets the blossoms flickering white 
i knew not skies could burn so blue
nor any breezes blow so light 
they blow an old-time way for me 
across the world to arcady 

oh what's the way to arcady 
sir poet with the rusty coat 
quit mocking of the song-bird's note 
how have you heart for any tune 
you with the wayworn russet shoon 
your scrip a-swinging by your side 
gapes with a gaunt mouth hungry-wide 
i'll brim it well with pieces red 
if you will tell the way to tread 

 oh i am bound for arcady 
 and if you but keep pace with me 
 you tread the way to arcady 

and where away lies arcady 
and how long yet may the journey be 

 ah that quoth he i do not know-- 
 across the clover and the snow-- 
 across the frost across the flowers-- 
 through summer seconds and winter hours 
 i've trod the way my whole life long 
 and know not now where it may be 
 my guide is but the stir to song 
 that tells me i can not go wrong 
 or clear or dark the pathway be 
 upon the road to arcady 

but how shall i do who cannot sing 
i was wont to sing once on a time--
there is never an echo now to ring
remembrance back to the trick of rhyme 

 'tis strange you cannot sing quoth he 
 the folk all sing in arcady 

but how may he find arcady
who hath not youth nor melody 

 what know you not old man quoth he --
 your hair is white your face is wise-- 
 that love must kiss that mortal's eyes 
 who hopes to see fair arcady 
 no gold can buy you entrance there 
 but beggared love may go all bare-- 
 no wisdom won with weariness 
 but love goes in with folly's dress-- 
 no fame that wit could ever win 
 but only love may lead love in 
 to arcady to arcady 

ah woe is me through all my days
wisdom and wealth i both have got 
and fame and name and great men's praise 
but love ah love i have it not 

there was a time when life was new--
but far away and half forgot--
i only know her eyes were blue 
but love--i fear i knew it not 
we did not wed for lack of gold 
and she is dead and i am old 
all things have come since then to me 
save love ah love and arcady 

 ah then i fear we part quoth he 
 my way's for love and arcady 

but you you fare alone like me 
the gray is likewise in your hair 
what love have you to lead you there 
to arcady to arcady 

 ah no not lonely do i fare 
 my true companion's memory 
 with love he fills the spring-time air 
 with love he clothes the winter tree 
 oh past this poor horizon's bound 
 my song goes straight to one who stands-- 
 her face all gladdening at the sound-- 
 to lead me to the spring-green lands 
 to wander with enlacing hands 
 the songs within my breast that stir 
 are all of her are all of her 
 my maid is dead long years quoth he 
 she waits for me in arcady 

 oh yon's the way to arcady 
 to arcady to arcady 
 oh yon's the way to arcady 
 where all the leaves are merry

eve's daughter 


i waited in the little sunny room 
the cool breeze waved the window-lace at play 
the white rose on the porch was all in bloom 
and out upon the bay
i watched the wheeling sea-birds go and come 

 such an old friend --she would not make me stay
while she bound up her hair i turned and lo 
dana in her shower and fit to slay
all a man's hoarded prudence at a blow 
gold hair that streamed away
as round some nymph a sunlit fountain's flow 
 she would not make me wait --but well i know
she took a good half-hour to loose and lay
those locks in dazzling disarrangement so 






on an intaglio head of minerva 


beneath the warrior's helm behold
the flowing tresses of the woman 
minerva pallas what you will--
a winsome creature greek or roman 

minerva no 'tis some sly minx
in cousin's helmet masquerading 
if not--then wisdom was a dame
for sonnets and for serenading 

i thought the goddess cold austere 
not made for love's despairs and blisses 
did pallas wear her hair like that 
was wisdom's mouth so shaped for kisses 

the nightingale should be her bird 
and not the owl big-eyed and solemn 
how very fresh she looks and yet
she's older far than trajan's column 

the magic hand that carved this face 
and set this vine-work round it running 
perhaps ere mighty phidias wrought
had lost its subtle skill and cunning 

who was he was he glad or sad 
who knew to carve in such a fashion 
perchance he graved the dainty head
for some brown girl that scorned his passion 

perchance in some still garden-place 
where neither fount nor tree to-day is 
he flung the jewel at the feet
of phryne or perhaps 'twas la s 

but he is dust we may not know
his happy or unhappy story 
nameless and dead these centuries 
his work outlives him--there's his glory 

both man and jewel lay in earth
beneath a lava-buried city 
the countless summers came and went
with neither haste nor hate nor pity 

years blotted out the man but left
the jewel fresh as any blossom 
till some visconti dug it up--
to rise and fall on mabel's bosom 

o nameless brother see how time
your gracious handiwork has guarded 
see how your loving patient art
has come at last to be rewarded 

who would not suffer slights of men 
and pangs of hopeless passion also 
to have his carven agate-stone
on such a bosom rise and fall so 






hunting-song 


oh who would stay indoor indoor 
when the horn is on the hill bugle tarantara 
with the crisp air stinging and the huntsmen singing 
and a ten-tined buck to kill 

before the sun goes down goes down 
we shall slay the buck of ten bugle tarantara 
and the priest shall say benison and we shall ha'e venison 
when we come home again 

let him that loves his ease his ease 
keep close and house him fair bugle tarantara 
he'll still be a stranger to the merry thrill of danger
and the joy of the open air 

but he that loves the hills the hills 
let him come out to-day bugle tarantara 
for the horses are neighing and the hounds are baying 
and the hunt's up and away 






parting 


my life closed twice before its close 
it yet remains to see
if immortality unveil
a third event to me 

so huge so hopeless to conceive 
as these that twice befell 
parting is all we know of heaven 
and all we need of hell 






when the sultan goes to ispahan 


 when the sultan shah-zaman 
 goes to the city ispahan 
even before he gets so far
as the place where the clustered palm-trees are 
at the last of the thirty palace-gates 
the flower of the harem rose-in-bloom 
orders a feast in his favorite room--
glittering squares of colored ice 
sweetened with syrop tinctured with spice 
creams and cordials and sugared dates 
syrian apples othmanee quinces 
limes and citrons and apricots 
and wines that are known to eastern princes 
and nubian slaves with smoking pots
of spic d meats and costliest fish
and all that the curious palate could wish 
pass in and out of the cedarn doors 
scattered over mosaic floors
are anemones myrtles and violets 
and a musical fountain throws its jets
of a hundred colors into the air 
the dusk sultana loosens her hair 
and stains with the henna-plant the tips
of her pointed nails and bites her lips
till they bloom again but alas that rose
not for the sultan buds and blows 
 not for the sultan shah-zaman 
 when he goes to the city ispahan 

then at a wave of her sunny hand
the dancing-girls of samarcand
glide in like shapes from fairy-land 
making a sudden mist in air
of fleecy veils and floating hair
and white arms lifted orient blood
runs in their veins shines in their eyes 
and there in this eastern paradise 
filled with the breath of sandal-wood 
and khoten musk and aloes and myrrh 
sits rose-in-bloom on a silk divan 
sipping the wines of astrakhan 
and her arab lover sits with her 
 that's when the sultan shah-zaman 
 goes to the city ispahan 

now when i see an extra light 
flaming flickering on the night
from my neighbor's casement opposite 
i know as well as i know to pray 
i know as well as a tongue can say 
 that the innocent sultan shah-zaman 
 has gone to the city isfahan 






night 


chaos of old was god's dominion 
'twas his belov d child his own first-born 
and he was ag d ere the thought of morn
shook the sheer steeps of black oblivion 
then all the works of darkness being done
through countless ons hopelessly forlorn 
out to the very utmost verge and bourn 
god at the last reluctant made the sun 
he loved his darkness still for it was old 
he grieved to see his eldest child take flight 
and when his fiat lux the death-knell tolled 
as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled 
he snatched a remnant flying into light
and strewed it with the stars and called it night 






he made the stars also 


vast hollow voids beyond the utmost reach
of suns their legions withering at his nod 
died into day hearing the voice of god 
and seas new made immense and furious each
plunged and rolled forward feeling for a beach 
he walked the waters with effulgence shod 
this being made he yearned for worlds to make
from other chaos out beyond our night--
for to create is still god's prime delight 
the large moon all alone sailed her dark lake 
and the first tides were moving to her might 
then darkness trembled and began to quake
big with the birth of stars and when he spake
a million worlds leapt into radiant light 






the sour winds 


wind of the north 
wind of the norland snows 
wind of the winnowed skies and sharp clear stars--
blow cold and keen across the naked hills 
and crisp the lowland pools with crystal films 
and blur the casement-squares with glittering ice 
but go not near my love 

wind of the west 
wind of the few far clouds 
wind of the gold and crimson sunset lands--
blow fresh and pure across the peaks and plains 
and broaden the blue spaces of the heavens 
and sway the grasses and the mountain pines 
but let my dear one rest 

wind of the east 
wind of the sunrise seas 
wind of the clinging mists and gray harsh rains--
blow moist and chill across the wastes of brine 
and shut the sun out and the moon and stars 
and lash the boughs against the dripping eaves 
yet keep thou from my love 

but thou sweet wind 
wind of the fragrant south 
wind from the bowers of jasmine and of rose--
over magnolia glooms and lilied lakes
and flowering forests come with dewy wings 
and stir the petals at her feet and kiss
the low mound where she lies 






the return 


now at last i am at home--
wind abeam and flooding tide 
and the offing white with foam 
and an old friend by my side
glad the long green waves to ride 

strange how we've been wandering
through the crowded towns for gain 
you and i who loved the sting
of the salt spray and the rain
and the gale across the main 

what world honors could avail
loss of this--the slanted mast 
and the roaring round the rail 
and the sheeted spray we cast
round us as we seaward passed 

as the sad land sinks apace 
with it sinks each thought of care 
think not now of aging face 
question not the whitening hair 
youth still beckons everywhere 

and the light we thought had fled
from the sky-line glows there now 
bends the same blue overhead 
and the waves we used to plow
part in beryl at the bow 

hours like this we two have known
in the old days when we sailed
seaward ere the night had flown 
or the morning star had paled
like the shy eyes love has veiled 

round our bow the ripples purled 
as the swift tide outward streamed
through a hushed and ghostly world 
where our harbor reaches seemed
like a river that we dreamed 

then we saw the black hills sway
in the waters' crinkled glass 
and the village wan and gray 
and the startled cattle pass
through the tangled meadow-grass 

through the glooming we have run
straight into the gates of day 
seen the crimson-edg d sun
burn the sea's gray bound away--
leap to universal sway 

little cared we where we drove
so the wind was strong and keen 
oh what sun-crowned waves we clove 
what cool shadows lurked between
those long combers pale and green 

graybeard pleasures are but toys 
sorrow shatters them at last 
for this brief hour we are boys 
trim the sheet and face the blast 
sail into the happy past 






bereaved 


let me come in where you sit weeping --aye 
let me who have not any child to die 
weep with you for the little one whose love
i have known nothing of 

the little arms that slowly slowly loosed
their pressure round your neck the hands you used
to kiss --such arms--such hands i never knew 
may i not weep with you 

fain would i be of service--say some thing 
between the tears that would be comforting --
but ah so sadder than yourselves am i 
who have no child to die 






the chariot 


because i could not stop for death 
he kindly stopped for me 
the carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality 

we slowly drove he knew no haste 
and i had put away
my labor and my leisure too 
for his civility 

we passed the school where children played 
their lessons scarcely done 
we passed the fields of gazing grain 
we passed the setting sun 

we paused before a house that seemed
a swelling of the ground 
the roof was scarcely visible 
the cornice but a mound 

since then 'tis centuries but each
feels shorter than the day
i first surmised the horses' heads
were toward eternity 






indian summer 


these are the days when birds come back 
a very few a bird or two 
to take a backward look 

these are the days when skies put on
the old old sophistries of june --
a blue and gold mistake 

oh fraud that cannot cheat the bee 
almost thy plausibility
induces my belief 

till ranks of seeds their witness bear 
and softly through the altered air
hurries a timid leaf 

oh sacrament of summer days 
oh last communion in the haze 
permit a child to join 

thy sacred emblems to partake 
thy consecrated bread to break 
taste thine immortal wine 






confided 


another lamb o lamb of god behold 
within this quiet fold 
among thy father's sheep
i lay to sleep 
a heart that never for a night did rest
beyond its mother's breast 
lord keep it close to thee 
lest waking it should bleat and pine for me 






in absence 


all that thou art not makes not up the sum
of what thou art belov d unto me 
all other voices wanting thine are dumb 
all vision in thine absence vacancy 






song of the chattahoochee 


out of the hills of habersham 
down the valleys of hall 
i hurry amain to reach the plain 
run the rapids and leap the fall
split at the rock and together again 
accept my bed or narrow or wide 
and flee from folly on every side
with a lover's pain to attain the plain
far from the hills of habersham 
far from the valleys of hall 

all down the hills of habersham 
all through the valleys of hall 
the rushes cried abide abide 
the wilful waterweeds held me thrall 
the laving laurel turned my tide 
the ferns and the fondling grass said stay 
the dewberry dipped for to work delay 
and the little reeds sighed abide abide 
 here in the hills of habersham 
 here in the valleys of hall 

high o'er the hills of habersham 
veiling the valleys of hall 
the hickory told me manifold
fair tales of shade the poplar tall
wrought me her shadowy self to hold 
the chestnut the oak the walnut the pine 
overleaning with flickering meaning and sign 
said pass not so cold these manifold 
 deep shades of the hills of habersham 
 these glades in the valleys of hall 

and oft in the hills of habersham 
and oft in the valleys of hall 
the white quartz shone and the smooth brook-stone
did bar me of passage with friendly brawl 
and many a luminous jewel lone
--crystals clear or acloud with mist 
ruby garnet and amethyst--
made lures with the lights of streaming stone
in the clefts of the hills of habersham 
in the beds of the valleys of hall 

but oh not the hills of habersham 
and oh not the valleys of hall
avail i am fain for to water the plain 
downward the voices of duty call--
downward to toil and be mixed with the main 
the dry fields burn and the mills are to turn 
and a myriad flowers mortally yearn 
and the lordly main from beyond the plain
calls o'er the hills of habersham 
calls through the valleys of hall

the sea's voice 




around the rocky headlands far and near 
the wakened ocean murmured with dull tongue
till all the coast's mysterious caverns rung
with the waves' voice barbaric hoarse and drear 
within this distant valley with rapt ear 
i listened thrilled as though a spirit sung 
or some gray god as when the world was young 
moaned to his fellow mad with rage or fear 
thus in the dark ere the first dawn methought
the sea's deep roar and sullen surge and shock
broke the long silence of eternity 
and echoed from the summits where god wrought 
building the world and ploughing the steep rock
with ploughs of ice-hills harnessed to the sea 




the sea is never quiet east and west
the nations hear it like the voice of fate 
within vast shores its strife makes desolate 
still murmuring mid storms that to its breast
return as eagles screaming to their nest 
is it the voice of worlds and isles that wait
while old earth crumbles to eternal rest 
or some hoar monster calling to his mate 
o ye that hear it moan about the shore 
be still and listen that loud voice hath sung
where mountains rise where desert sands are blown 
and when man's voice is dumb forevermore
'twill murmur on its craggy shores among 
singing of gods and nations overthrown 






at gibraltar 




england i stand on thy imperial ground 
not all a stranger as thy bugles blow 
i feel within my blood old battles flow --
the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found 
still surging dark against the christian bound
wide islam presses well its peoples know
thy heights that watch them wandering below 
i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound 
i turn and meet the cruel turbaned face 
england 'tis sweet to be so much thy son 
i feel the conqueror in my blood and race 
last night trafalgar awed me and to-day
gibraltar wakened hark thy evening gun
startles the desert over africa 




thou art the rock of empire set mid-seas
between the east and west that god has built 
advance thy roman borders where thou wilt 
while run thy armies true with his decrees 
law justice liberty --great gifts are these 
watch that they spread where english blood is spilt 
lest mixt and sullied with his country's guilt 
the soldier's life-stream flow and heaven displease 
two swords there are one naked apt to smite 
thy blade of war and battled-storied one
rejoices in the sheath and hides from light
american i am would wars were done 
now westward look my country bids good-night --
peace to the world from ports without a gun 






jerry an' me 


no matter how the chances are 
nor when the winds may blow 
my jerry there has left the sea
with all its luck an' woe 
for who would try the sea at all 
must try it luck or no 

they told him--lor' men take no care
how words they speak may fall--
they told him blunt he was too old 
too slow with oar an' trawl 
an' this is how he left the sea
an' luck an' woe an' all 

take any man on sea or land
out of his beaten way 
if he is young 'twill do but then 
if he is old an' gray 
a month will be a year to him 
be all to him you may 

he sits by me but most he walks
the door-yard for a deck 
an' scans the boat a-goin' out
till she becomes a speck 
then turns away his face as wet
as if she were a wreck 

i cannot bring him back again 
the days when we were wed 
but he shall never know--my man--
the lack o' love or bread 
while i can cast a stitch or fill
a needleful o' thread 

god pity me i'd most forgot
how many yet there be 
whose goodmen full as old as mine
are somewhere on the sea 
who hear the breakin' bar an' think
o' jerry home an'--me 






the gravedigger 


oh the shambling sea is a sexton old 
and well his work is done 
with an equal grave for lord and knave 
he buries them every one 

then hoy and rip with a rolling hip 
he makes for the nearest shore 
and god who sent him a thousand ship 
will send him a thousand more 
but some he'll save for a bleaching grave 
and shoulder them in to shore --
shoulder them in shoulder them in 
shoulder them in to shore 

oh the ships of greece and the ships of tyre
went out and where are they 
in the port they made they are delayed
with the ships of yesterday 

he followed the ships of england far
as the ships of long ago 
and the ships of france they led him a dance 
but he laid them all arow 

oh a loafing idle lubber to him
is the sexton of the town 
for sure and swift with a guiding lift 
he shovels the dead men down 

but though he delves so fierce and grim 
his honest graves are wide 
as well they know who sleep below
the dredge of the deepest tide 

oh he works with a rollicking stave at lip 
and loud is the chorus skirled 
with the burly note of his rumbling throat
he batters it down the world 

he learned it once in his father's house
where the ballads of eld were sung 
and merry enough is the burden rough 
but no man knows the tongue 

oh fair they say was his bride to see 
and wilful she must have been 
that she could bide at his gruesome side
when the first red dawn came in 

and sweet they say is her kiss to those
she greets to his border home 
and softer than sleep her hand's first sweep
that beckons and they come 

oh crooked is he but strong enough
to handle the tallest mast 
from the royal barque to the slaver dark 
he buries them all at last 

then hoy and rip with a rolling hip 
he makes for the nearest shore 
and god who sent him a thousand ship 
will send him a thousand more 
but some he'll save for a bleaching grave 
and shoulder them in to shore --
shoulder them in shoulder them in 
shoulder them in to shore 






the absence of little wesley 




sence little wesley went the place seems all so strange and still--
w'y i miss his yell o' gran'pap as i'd miss the whipperwill 
and to think i ust to scold him fer his everlastin' noise 
when i on'y rickollect him as the best o' little boys 
i wisht a hunderd times a day 'at he'd come trompin' in 
and all the noise he ever made was twic't as loud ag'in --
it 'u'd seem like some soft music played on some fine insturment 
'longside o' this loud lonesomeness sence little wesley went 

of course the clock don't tick no louder than it ust to do--
yit now they's times it 'pears like it 'u'd bu'st itse'f in two 
and let a rooster suddent-like crow som'er's clos't around 
and seems's ef mighty nigh it it 'u'd lift me off the ground 
and same with all the cattle when they bawl around the bars 
in the red o' airly mornin' er the dusk and dew and stars 
when the neighbers' boys 'at passes never stop but jes' go on 
a-whistlin' kind o' to theirse'v's--sence little wesley's gone 

and then o' nights when mother's settin' up oncommon late 
a-bilin' pears er somepin' and i set and smoke and wait 
tel the moon out through the winder don't look bigger'n a dime 
and things keeps gittin' stiller--stiller--stiller all the time --
i've ketched myse'f a-wishin' like--as i dumb on the cheer
to wind the clock as i hev done fer mor'n fifty year --
a-wishin' 'at the time bed come fer us to go to bed 
with our last prayers and our last tears sence little wesley's dead 






be thou a bird my soul 


be thou a bird my soul and mount and soar
out of thy wilderness 
till earth grows less and less 
heaven more and more 

be thou a bird and mount and soar and sing 
till all the earth shall be
vibrant with ecstasy
beneath thy wing 

be thou a bird and trust the autumn come 
that through the pathless air
thou shalt find otherwhere
unerring home 




opportunity 


this i beheld or dreamed it in a dream --
there spread a cloud of dust along a plain 
and underneath the cloud or in it raged
a furious battle and men yelled and swords
shocked upon swords and shields a prince's banner
wavered then staggered backward hemmed by foes 
a craven hung along the battle's edge 
and thought had i a sword of keener steel--
that blue blade that the king's son bears --but this
blunt thing --he snapt and flung it from his hand 
and lowering crept away and left the field 
then came the king's son wounded sore bestead 
and weaponless and saw the broken sword 
hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand 
and ran and snatched it and with battle-shout
lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down 
and saved a great cause that heroic day 






dutch lullaby 


wynken blynken and nod one night
sailed off in a wooden shoe --
sailed on a river of misty light
into a sea of dew 
 where are you going and what do you wish 
the old moon asked the three 
 we have come to fish for the herring-fish
that live in this beautiful sea 
nets of silver and gold have we 
said wynken 
blynken 
and nod 

the old moon laughed and sung a song 
as they rocked in the wooden shoe 
and the wind that sped them all night long
ruffled the waves of dew 
the little stars were the herring-fish
that lived in the beautiful sea 
 now cast your nets wherever you wish 
but never afeard are we 
so cried the stars to the fishermen three 
wynken 
blynken 
and nod 

all night long their nets they threw
for the fish in the twinkling foam 
then down from the sky came the wooden shoe 
bringing the fishermen home 
'twas all so pretty a sail it seemed
as if it could not be 
and some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
of sailing that beautiful sea 
but i shall name you the fishermen three 
wynken 
blynken 
and nod 

wynken and blynken are two little eyes 
and nod is a little head 
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
is a wee one's trundle-bed 
so shut your eyes while mother sings
of wonderful sights that be 
and you shall see the beautiful things
as you rock on the misty sea
where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three --
wynken 
blynken 
and nod

the maryland yellow-throat 

while may bedecks the naked trees
with tassels and embroideries 
and many blue-eyed violets beam
along the edges of the stream 
i hear a voice that seems to say 
now near at hand now far away 
 witchery--witchery--witchery 

an incantation so serene 
so innocent befits the scene 
there's magic in that small bird's note--
see there he flits--the yellow-throat 
a living sunbeam tipped with wings 
a spark of light that shines and sings
 witchery--witchery--witchery 

you prophet with a pleasant name 
if out of mary-land you came 
you know the way that thither goes
where mary's lovely garden grows 
fly swiftly back to her i pray 
and try to call her down this way 
 witchery--witchery--witchery 

tell her to leave her cockleshells 
and all her little silver bells
that blossom into melody 
and all her maids less fair than she 
she does not need these pretty things 
for everywhere she comes she brings
 witchery--witchery--witchery 

the woods are greening overhead 
and flowers adorn each mossy bed 
the waters babble as they run--
one thing is lacking only one 
if mary were but here to-day 
i would believe your charming lay 
 witchery--witchery--witchery 

along the shady road i look--
who's coming now across the brook 
a woodland maid all robed in white--
the leaves dance round her with delight 
the stream laughs out beneath her feet--
sing merry bird the charm's complete 
 witchery--witchery--witchery

the silence of love 


oh inexpressible as sweet 
love takes my voice away 
i cannot tell thee when we meet 
what most i long to say 

but hadst thou hearing in thy heart
to know what beats in mine 
then shouldst thou walk where'er thou art 
in melodies divine 

so warbling birds lift higher notes
than to our ears belong 
the music fills their throbbing throats 
but silence steals the song 






the secret 


nightingales warble about it 
all night under blossom and star 
the wild swan is dying without it 
and the eagle cryeth afar 
the sun he doth mount but to find it 
searching the green earth o'er 
but more doth a man's heart mind it 
oh more more more 

over the gray leagues of ocean
the infinite yearneth alone 
the forests with wandering emotion
the thing they know not intone 
creation arose but to see it 
a million lamps in the blue 
but a lover he shall be it
if one sweet maid is true 






the whip-poor-will 


do you remember father --
it seems so long ago --
the day we fished together
along the pocono 
at dusk i waited for you 
beside the lumber-mill 
and there i heard a hidden bird
that chanted whip-poor-will 
 whippoorwill whippoorwill 
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill 

the place was all deserted 
the mill-wheel hung at rest 
the lonely star of evening
was quivering in the west 
the veil of night was falling 
the winds were folded still 
and everywhere the trembling air
re-echoed whip-poor-will 
 whippoorwill whippoorwill 
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill 

you seemed so long in coming 
i felt so much alone 
the wide dark world was round me 
and life was all unknown 
the hand of sorrow touched me 
and made my senses thrill
with all the pain that haunts the strain
of mournful whip-poor-will 
 whippoorwill whippoorwill 
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill 

what did i know of trouble 
an idle little lad 
i had not learned the lessons
that make men wise and sad 
i dreamed of grief and parting 
and something seemed to fill
my heart with tears while in my ears
resounded whip-poor-will 
 whippoorwill whippoorwill 
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill 

'twas but a shadowy sadness 
that lightly passed away 
but i have known the substance
of sorrow since that day 
for nevermore at twilight 
beside the silent mill 
i'll wait for you in the falling dew 
and hear the whip-poor-will 
 whippoorwill whippoorwill 
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill 

but if you still remember 
in that fair land of light 
the pains and fears that touch us
along this edge of night 
i think all earthly grieving 
and all our mortal ill 
to you must seem like a boy's sad dream 
who hears the whip-poor-will 
 whippoorwill whippoorwill 
a passing thrill-- whippoorwill

fertility 


spirit that moves the sap in spring 
when lusty male birds fight and sing 
inform my words and make my lines
as sweet as flowers as strong as vines 

let mine be the freshening power
of rain on grass of dew on flower 
the fertilizing song be mine 
nut-flavored racy keen as wine 

let some procreant truth exhale
from me before my forces fail 
or ere the ecstatic impulse go 
let all my buds to blossoms blow 

if quick sound seed be wanting where
the virgin soil feels sun and air 
and longs to fill a higher state 
there let my meanings germinate 

let not my strength be spilled for naught 
but in some fresher vessel caught 
be blended into sweeter forms 
and fraught with purer aims and charms 

let bloom-dust of my life be blown
to quicken hearts that flower alone 
around my knees let scions rise
with heavenward-pointed destinies 

and when i fall like some old tree 
and subtile change makes mould of me 
there let earth show a fertile line
whence perfect wild-flowers leap and shine 






the veery 


the moonbeams over arno's vale in silver flood were pouring 
when first i heard the nightingale a long-lost love deploring 
so passionate so full of pain it sounded strange and eerie 
i longed to hear a simpler strain --the wood notes of the veery 

the laverock sings a bonny lay above the scottish heather 
it sprinkles down from far away like light and love together 
he drops the golden notes to greet his brooding mate his dearie 
i only know one song more sweet --the vespers of the veery 

in english gardens green and bright and full of fruity treasure 
i heard the blackbird with delight repeat his merry measure 
the ballad was a pleasant one the tune was loud and cheery 
and yet with every setting sun i listened for the veery 

but far away and far away the tawny thrush is singing 
new england woods at close of day with that clear chant are ringing 
and when my light of life is low and heart and flesh are weary 
i fain would hear before i go the wood notes of the veery

the eavesdropper 


in a still room at hush of dawn 
my love and i lay side by side
and heard the roaming forest wind
stir in the paling autumn-tide 

i watched her earth-brown eyes grow glad
because the round day was so fair 
while memories of reluctant night
lurked in the blue dusk of her hair 

outside a yellow maple-tree 
shifting upon the silvery blue
with small innumerable sound 
rustled to let the sunlight through 

the livelong day the elvish leaves
danced with their shadows on the floor 
and the lost children of the wind
went straying homeward by our door 

and all the swarthy afternoon
we watched the great deliberate sun
walk through the crimsoned hazy world 
counting his hilltops one by one 

then as the purple twilight came
and touched the vines along our eaves 
another shadow stood without
and gloomed the dancing of the leaves 

the silence fell on my love's lips 
her great brown eyes were veiled and sad
with pondering some maze of dream 
though all the splendid year was glad 

restless and vague as a gray wind
her heart had grown she knew not why 
but hurrying to the open door 
against the verge of western sky

i saw retreating on the hills 
looming and sinister and black 
the stealthy figure swift and huge
of one who strode and looked not back 






sesostris 


sole lord of lords and very king of kings 
he sits within the desert carved in stone 
inscrutable colossal and alone 
and ancienter than memory of things 
graved on his front the sacred beetle clings 
disdain sits on his lips and in a frown
scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown 
the affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings
anear this presence the long caravan's
dazed camels stop and mute the bedouins stare 
this symbol of past power more than man's
presages doom kings look--and kings despair 
their sceptres tremble in their jewelled hands
and dark thrones totter in the baleful air 









american poetry before bryant was considerable in amount but with few
exceptions it must be looked for by the curious student in the
graveyard of old anthologies who now reads the simple cobbler of
agawam in america the tenth muse lately sprung up in america the
day of doom m'fingal or the columbiad skipping a generation from
barlow's death who reads with much seriousness any one of the group of
poets of which bryant in his earliest period was the centre halleck 
pierpont sprague drake dana percival allston brainard mrs 
osgood and miss brooks a few of them to be sure are remembered by an
occasional lyric --halleck by marco bozzaris a spirited ode in the
manner of campbell pierpont by his ringing lines warren's address to
the american soldiers drake by the american flag conventional but
not commonplace and marked by one very imaginative line and allston by
two rather excellent lyrics rosalie and america to great britain 
the first poet to accomplish work of high sustained excellence was
bryant his poetry though never impassioned is uniformly elegant it
is often as chaste as landor at his best but it never surprises it is
not emotional personal suggestively imaginative in fact bryant's
muse is not lyrical with the exception of pinkney and hoffman whose
 sparkling and bright if technically defective is a true song we
must wait for our lyric poet till we reach edgar allan poe the
greatest--one inclines to say the only--master of musical quality in
verse whom america has produced 

 the wild honeysuckle --philip freneau born in was a soldier in
the american revolution though never rising quite into the highest
class of poets he is our first genuine singer the indian
burying-ground and to a honey-bee are only less successful than the
graceful lines quoted 

 a health --poe was an enthusiastic admirer of this poem he pronounced
it in his essay entitled the poetic principle full of brilliancy
and spirit and added it was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have
been born too far south had he been a new englander it is probable
that he would have been ranked as the first of american lyrists by that
magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of american
letters in conducting the thing called the north american review 
this passage very characteristic of poe's criticisms illustrates both
his championship of favorites and unmerciful scourging of foes 

 unseen spirits --the earnest sincerity evident in every line of this
poem removes it at once from the company of those gay society verses
sparkling with conceits which won for willis the satiric comment of
lowell in a fable for critics 

 there is willis all natty and jaunty and gay 
who says his best things in so foppish a way 
with conceits and pet phrases so thickly o'erlaying 'em 
that one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying 'em 
over-ornament ruins both poem and prose --
just conceive of a muse with a ring in her nose 

had willis written more such lyrics as unseen spirits his fame could
hardly have proved so ephemeral poe considered this poem willis's best 
and i see no ground for calling the critic's judgment in question 

 to helen --this brief lyric written in the poet's youth is not only
among the most exquisite from his pen but it furnishes one of the most
famous among current quotations 

 the glory that was greece 
and the grandeur that was rome 

 on the death of joseph rodman drake --these manly lines have yielded
another phrase to the world's memory hardly any quotation is more
hackneyed than the last two verses of the first stanza drake was a
young poet the intimate friend and literary co-laborer of halleck who
died september in his twenty-fifth year 

 to the fringed gentian --this lyric well illustrates what mr stedman
has aptly termed bryant's doric simplicity nothing of wordsworth's is
freer from ornament or from the least trace of affectation 

 the raven --though not belonging to the highest order of poetry the
raven still maintains its position at the head of its class no more
astonishing tour de force can be found in english literature 

 nature --generally regarded i think the finest of longfellow's if
not of american sonnets 

 ichabod --occasioned by the defection and fall of daniel webster it
is worthy a place by the side of browning's lost leader in later
years whittier wrote a poem on the theme which while not a retraction
of his former position is penned in a tenderer more tolerant mood 
 the lost occasion is its title and it is only just to the poet to
read this second lyric hardly less successful in connection with the
first 

 old ironsides -- old ironsides was the popular name for the frigate
 constitution dr holmes's poem appeared in the boston advertiser 
 at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for
service 

 bedouin song --one of the most spirited most genuinely lyrical of
american poems 

 skipper ireson's ride --these lines have an easy swinging quality
that is quite inimitable one inclines to agree with mr stedman of
all our poets he whittier is the most natural balladist 

 the village blacksmith --the directness and homely strength of the
village blacksmith have made it deservedly popular one questions
whether the last stanza might not have been omitted with advantage both
to the unity and force of the poem 

 the last leaf --this masterpiece of mingled humor and pathos was a
favorite poem of abraham lincoln 

 the old kentucky home --the sincere and tender sentiment of this
song no less than its popular melody has made it for many years a
favorite even better known is foster's old folks at home which is
said to have had a larger sale than any other american song 

 carolina --the concluding lines of this lyric have an imaginative
vigor rare in american poetry four stanzas are omitted 

 dirge for a soldier --boker's dirge was written in memory of general
philip kearney 

 battle-hymn of the republic --written in december while mrs 
howe was on a visit to washington soon after the writer's return to
boston the lines were accepted for publication in the atlantic monthly 
by james t fields who suggested the title of the poem the song did
not at first receive much notice but before the civil war was over had
become very popular 

 my maryland --a poem of great strength and beauty though of uneven
merit it is unfortunately marred by a few rather intemperate
expressions the sincerity of feeling is everywhere so evident however 
that these must be forgiven the lines were written by a native of
baltimore prof james randall and were first published in april 
the author of the famous song was teaching in a louisiana college when
he read in a new orleans paper the news of the attack on the
massachusetts troops as they passed through baltimore this newspaper
account inspired the verses 

 in the hospital --this poem which has enjoyed at best a newspaper
immortality deserves to be more widely known its simplicity 
directness and truth of feeling are quite beyond praise according to a
story which one dislikes to believe apocryphal these lines were found
under the pillow of a wounded soldier near port royal south carolina 
in 

 days --regarded from the point of view of artistic form perhaps
nothing of emerson's is quite so flawless as days a poem which for
conciseness and polish is worthy to be called classic 

 a death-bed --this is a worthy companion-piece to that other miniature
classic thomas hood's song beginning we watched her breathing
through the night 

 telling the bees -- a remarkable custom brought from the old country 
formerly prevailed in the rural districts of new england on the death
of a member of the family the bees were at once informed of the event 
and their hives dressed in mourning the ceremonial was supposed to be
necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
new home this poem of whittier's is almost his highest achievement 
lowell said in writing of the quaker poet appleton's cyclopedia of
american biography vi many of his poems such for example as
'telling the bees' in which description and sentiment mutually inspire
each other are as fine as any in the language i often think however 
that whittier will live longest by his hymns and poems of purely
religious devotion i know of nothing similar in english that surpasses
 the eternal goodness and perhaps half a dozen other poems 

 katie --about one-third of timrod's graceful poem which bears this
title this is one of the few cases where i have ventured to make
omissions 

 thalatta --regarding this poem thomas wentworth higginson says in
 the new world and the new book who knows but that when all else of
american literature has vanished in forgetfulness some single little
masterpiece like this may remain to show the high-water mark not merely
of a single poet but of a nation and a generation the author of
 thalatta was a dartmouth graduate a teacher and a disciple of
emerson 

 the fall of the leaf --thoreau's prose is known universally his verse
has not won as yet the recognition it deserves it has little lyrical
quality but for unconventionality charming turns of phrase and the
intimate knowledge of nature it reveals it is almost alone in american
poetry 

 the rhodora -- the rhodora has a conciseness and unity too rare in
emerson's poetry which beautiful in details is strangely uneven we
sigh as we think what an unrivalled lyric poet emerson would have been
had he been sustained at the heights he was capable of reaching no one
surpasses emerson at his best he is almost a great poet 

 the chambered nautilus --many think this holmes's finest poem it is
taken from the autocrat of the breakfast table 

 thought --helen jackson is perhaps the most gifted of american women
poets emily dickinson is more imaginative but her utter scorn of form
in composition makes her work unique as it is less satisfying mrs 
jackson was a favorite with emerson and he is said to have liked best
among her poems this sonnet thought 

 on a bust of dante --parsons one of the best of american poets is
one of the most neglected stedman is inclined to think on a bust of
dante the finest of american lyrics see the nature of poetry 

 the port of skips --in a recent review of american literature in the
london ath neum occurs this sentence in point of power workmanship 
and feeling among all poems written by americans we are inclined to
give first place to the 'port of ships ' of joaquin miller 

 evening song --no poem of lanier is more free from his characteristic
faults one regrets that so much of his work highly imaginative as it
is is marred by over-elaboration and artificiality 

 a woman's thought --the striking reality and directness of this lyric 
its immense emotional undercurrent and its abrupt almost gasping
metre admirably suited to the impassioned mood of the speaker --these
are a few of the qualities that combine to make a woman's thought one
of the most remarkable poems in the book 

 the white jessamine --one of the most charming of father tabb's
lyrics the verse of this poet is uneven in merit he is too prone to
merely fanciful conceits but at his best tabb is imaginative as for
example in the lines where he says of angelo that he--

 from the sterile womb of stone 
raised children unto god 

always artistic tabb's verse usually suggests workmanship it is more
thoughtful than spontaneous his religious poetry presents in the main 
a rather striking similarity to the work of george herbert 

 the battle-field --miss dickinson has much of the witchcraft and
subtlety of william blake many verses of the shy recluse whom mr 
higginson so happily has introduced to the world are not only daring
and unconventional but recklessly defiant of form but as her editor
has well said when a thought takes one's breath away a lesson on
grammar seems an impertinence emily dickinson had more than a message 
more than the charm of unexpectedness more than the gift of
phrase --she had and of how many americans can this be said an
intense imagination 

 fertility --this selection appears in the collected poems of maurice
thompson houghton mifflin co under the title of a
prelude 

 sesostris --of this poem mr stoddard has the high praise that in
imaginative quality it is unequalled in nineteenth century literature 
unless by leigh hunt's sonnet on the nile the same critic does not
scruple to declare of mr mifflin that he has a glorious imagination 
and to prophesy for him a distinguished future seldom indeed has a
first book of verse won such instant and universal appreciation as mr 
mifflin's volume of sonnets just issued as the american treasury goes
to press 







a blight a gloom i know not what 

all that thou art not makes not up the sum 

all the long august afternoon 

a man said unto his angel 

another lamb o lamb of god behold 

around the rocky headlands far and near 

as a fond mother when the day is o'er 

as a twig trembles which a bird 

at midnight in the month of june 

at sea are tossing ships 

at the king's gate the subtle noon 

ay tear her tattered ensign down 


be thou a bird my soul and mount and soar 

because i could not stop for death 

bedtime's come fu' little boys 

behind him lay the gray azores 

beneath the warrior's helm behold 

birds are singing round my window 

burly dozing bumble-bee 

by the rude bridge that arched the flood 


chaos of old was god's dominion 

close his eyes his work is done 


dark as the clouds of even 

daughters of time the hypocritic days 

dear common flower that grow'st beside the way 

dear yesterday glide not so fast 

do you remember father 


england i stand on thy imperial ground 


fair flower that dost so comely grow 

farragut farragut 

from the desert i come to thee 


 give us a song the soldiers cried 

green be the turf above thee 


helen thy beauty is to me 

her hands are cold her face is white 

here is the place right over the hill 

her suffering ended with the day 

how dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood 


i am a woman--therefore i may not 

i fill this cup to one made up 

i have a little kinsman 

i knew she lay above me 

i lay me down to sleep 

i saw him once before 

i saw the twinkle of white feet 

i stand upon the summit of my years 

i waited in the little sunny room 

in a still room at hush of dawn 

in heaven a spirit doth dwell 

in may when sea-winds pierced our solitudes 

in the greenest of our valleys 

in the summer even 

it may be through some foreign grace 

it was many and many a year ago 

it was nothing but a rose i gave her 

it was the schooner hesperus 


just where the treasury's marble front 


lear and cordelia 'twas an ancient tale 

let me come in where you sit weeping --aye 

let me move slowly through the street 

lo death has reared himself a throne 

look off dear love across the sallow sands 

look out upon the stars my love 


men say the sullen instrument 

mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord 

my books i'd fain cast off i cannot read 

my heart i cannot still it 

my life closed twice before its close 

my life is like the summer rose 

my mind lets go a thousand things 


nightingales warble about it 

no matter how the chances are 

not a hand has lifted the latchet 

not a kiss in life but one kiss at life's end 

not as all other women are 

now at last i am at home 


o death when thou shalt come to me 

o fairest of the rural maids 

o marvel fruit of fruits i pause 

o messenger art thou the king or i 

o nature i do not aspire 

of all the rides since the birth of time 

oh inexpressible as sweet 

oh the shambling sea is a sexton old 

oh who would stay indoor indoor 

 oh what's the way to arcady 

old sorrow i shall meet again 

once it smiled a silent dell 

once this soft turf this rivulet's sands 

once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary 

out of the hills of habersham 


prithee tell me dimple-chin 


see from this counterfeit of him 

sence little wesley went the place seems all so strange and still 

sky in its lucent splendor lifted 

so fallen so lost the light withdrawn 

sole lord of lords and very king of kings 

southward with fleet of ice 

sparkling and bright in liquid light 

spirit that moves the sap in spring 

still in thy love i trust 

such special sweetness was about 


the apples are ripe in the orchard 

the dawn came in through the bars of the blind 

the day is done and the darkness 

the despot treads thy sacred sands 

the despot's heel is on thy shore 

the evening of the year draws on 

the handful here that once was mary's earth 

the little toy dog is covered with dust 

the moonbeams over arno's vale in silver flood were pouring 

the new moon hung in the sky 

the pines were dark on ramoth hill 

the royal feast was done the king 

the shadows lay along broadway 

the sky is dark and dark the bay below 

the sun shines bright in the old kentucky home 

the tide rises the tide falls 

the wind from out the west is blowing 

there are gains for all our losses 

there is a city builded by no hand 

these are the days when birds come back 

this bronze doth keep the very form and mold 

this i beheld or dreamed it in a dream 

this is palm sunday mindful of the day 

this is the burden of the heart 

this is the ship of pearl which poets feign 

thou blossom bright with autumn dew 

thou unrelenting past 

thou wast all that to me love 

thought is deeper than all speech 

three roses wan as moonlight and weighed down 


under a spreading chestnut-tree 

upon a cloud among the stars we stood 


vast hollow voids beyond the utmost reach 


we sat within the farmhouse old 

what cringe to europe band it all in one 

what may we take into the vast forever 

when first the bride and bridegroom wed 

when i was a beggarly boy 

 when the sultan shah-zaman 

while may bedecks the naked trees 

whither midst falling dew 

who has robbed the ocean cave 

wind of the north 

wynken blynken and nod one night 


years have flown since i knew thee first 

you know the old hidalgo
