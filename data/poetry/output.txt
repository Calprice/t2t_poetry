then blooms each thing then maids dance in a ring
cold doth not sting the pretty birds do sing
cuckoo jug-jug pu-we to-witta-woo
lambs frisk and play the shepherds pipe all day
and we hear aye birds tune their merry lay
cuckoo jug-jug pu-we to-witta-woo
young lovers meet old wives a-sunning sit
in every street these tunes our ears do greet
cuckoo jug-jug pu-we to-witta-woo
spring the sweet spring
and paint the sable skies
with azure white and red
rouse memnon's mother from her tithon's bed
that she may thy career with roses spread
the nightingales thy coming eachwhere sing
make an eternal spring
give life to this dark world which lieth dead
spread forth thy golden hair
in larger locks than thou wast wont before
and emperor-like decore
with diadem of pearl thy temples fair
chase hence the ugly night
which serves but to make dear thy glorious light
that day long wish d day
of all my life so dark
if cruel stars have not my ruin sworn
and fates not hope betray
which purely white deserves
an everlasting diamond should it mark
this is the morn should bring unto this grove
my love to hear and recompense my love
fair king who all preserves
but show thy blushing beams
and thou two sweeter eyes
shalt see than those which by pen us' streams
did once thy heart surprize
now flora deck thyself in fairest guise
if that ye winds would hear
a voice surpassing far amphion's lyre
your furious chiding stay
let zephyr only breathe
and with her tresses play
--the winds all silent are
and phoebus in his chair
ensaffroning sea and air
makes vanish every star
night like a drunkard reels
beyond the hills to shun his flaming wheels
the fields with flowers are deck'd in every hue
the clouds with orient gold spangle their blue
here is the pleasant place--
and nothing wanting is save she alas
the rich proud cost of out-worn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down-razed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
that time will come and take my love away
but weep to have that which it fears to lose
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
against the wreckful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
that in black ink my love may still shine bright
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hills and valleys dale and field
and all the craggy mountains yield
and see the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers to whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals
and a thousand fragrant posies
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle
which from our pretty lambs we pull
fair-lined slippers for the cold
with buckles of the purest gold
with coral clasps and amber studs
and if these pleasures may thee move
come live with me and be my love
as precious as the gods do eat
shall on an ivory table be
prepared each day for thee and me
for thy delight each may-morning
if these delights thy mind may move
then live with me and be my love
cannot live together
youth is full of pleasance
age is full of care
youth like summer morn
age like winter weather
youth like summer brave
age like winter bare
youth is full of sport
age's breath is short
youth is nimble age is lame
youth is hot and bold
age is weak and cold
youth is wild and age is tame --
age i do abhor thee
youth i do adore thee
o my love my love is young
age i do defy thee--
o sweet shepherd hie thee
for methinks thou stay'st too long
who loves to lie with me
and tune his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat--
come hither come hither come hither
here shall we see
no enemy
but winter and rough weather
and loves to live i' the sun
seeking the food he eats
and pleased with what he gets--
come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see
no enemy
but winter and rough weather
with a hey and a ho and a hey-nonino
that o'er the green cornfield did pass
in the spring time the only pretty ring time
when birds do sing hey ding a ding
sweet lovers love the spring
between the acres of the rye
these pretty country folks would lie
this carol they began that hour
how that life was but a flower
and therefore take the present time
with a hey and a ho and a hey-nonino
for love is crown d with the prime
in spring time the only pretty ring time
when birds do sing hey ding a ding
sweet lovers love the spring
against thy strength
distance and length
do what thou canst for alteration
for hearts of truest mettle
absence doth join and time doth settle
he soon hath found
affection's ground
beyond time place and all mortality
to hearts that cannot vary
absence is presence time doth tarry
that i can catch her
where none can watch her
in some close corner of my brain
there i embrace and kiss her
and so i both enjoy and miss her
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those --
though you do any thing he thinks no ill
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old december's bareness everywhere
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease
but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
featured like him like him with friends possest
desiring this man's art and that man's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
haply i think on thee--and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
that then i scorn to change my state with kings
though absence seem'd my flame to qualify
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stain'd
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
save thou my rose in it thou art my all
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers' pride
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
white as the sun fair as the lily
heigh ho how do i love thee
i do love thee as my lambs
are belov d of their dams
how blest were i if thou would'st prove me
that in thy sweets all sweets encloses
fair sweet how do i love thee
i do love thee as each flower
loves the sun's life-giving power
for dead thy breath to life might move me
when all thy praises are express d
dear joy how do i love thee
as the birds do love the spring
or the bees their careful king
then in requite sweet virgin love me
where all imperial glory shines
of selfsame colour is her hair
whether unfolded or in twines
heigh ho fair rosaline
her eyes are sapphires set in snow
resembling heaven by every wink
the gods do fear whenas they glow
and i do tremble when i think
heigh ho would she were mine
that beautifies aurora's face
or like the silver crimson shroud
that phoebus' smiling looks doth grace
heigh ho fair rosaline
her lips are like two budded roses
whom ranks of lilies neighbour nigh
within which bounds she balm encloses
apt to entice a deity
heigh ho would she were mine
where love himself imprison'd lies
to watch for glances every hour
from her divine and sacred eyes
heigh ho fair rosaline
her paps are centres of delight
her breasts are orbs of heavenly frame
where nature moulds the dew of light
to feed perfection with the same
heigh ho would she were mine
with marble white with sapphire blue
her body every way is fed
yet soft in touch and sweet in view
heigh ho fair rosaline
nature herself her shape admires
the gods are wounded in her sight
and love forsakes his heavenly fires
and at her eyes his brand doth light
heigh ho would she were mine
the absence of fair rosaline
since for a fair there's fairer none
nor for her virtues so divine
heigh ho fair rosaline
heigh ho my heart would god that she were mine
where fairest shades did hide her
the winds blew calm the birds did sing
the cool streams ran beside her
to see what was forbidden
but better memory said fie
so vain desire was chidden --
hey nonny nonny o
hey nonny nonny
when fond imagination
seem d to see but could not tell
her feature or her fashion
but ev'n as babes in dreams do smile
and sometimes fall a-weeping
so i awaked as wise this while
as when i fell a-sleeping --
hey nonny nonny o
hey nonny nonny
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer's lease hath all too short a date
and often is his gold complexion dimm'd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
so long lives this and this gives life to thee
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have exprest
ev'n such a beauty as you master now
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they look'd but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
love whose month is ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen 'gan passage find
that the lover sick to death
wish'd himself the heaven's breath
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alack my hand is sworn
ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
do not call it sin in me
that i am forsworn for thee
thou for whom e'en jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love
of such a truth as i have meant
my great travail so gladly spent
forget not yet
the weary life ye know since whan
the suit the service none tell can
forget not yet
the cruel wrong the scornful ways
the painful patience in delays
forget not yet
how long ago hath been and is
the mind that never meant amiss--
forget not yet
the which so long hath thee so loved
whose steadfast faith yet never moved--
forget not this
and dost prejudge thy bliss and spoil thy rest
then thou would'st melt the ice out of thy breast
and thy relenting heart would kindly warm
what world of loving wonders should'st thou see
for if i saw thee once transform'd in me
then in thy bosom i would pour my soul
and if that aught mischanced thou should'st not moan
nor bear the burthen of thy griefs alone
no i would have my share in what were thine
this happy harmony would make them none
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove --
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out ev'n to the edge of doom --
i never writ nor no man ever loved
by just exchange one to the other given
i hold his dear and mine he cannot miss
there never was a better bargain driven
my true love hath my heart and i have his
my heart in him his thoughts and senses guides
he loves my heart for once it was his own
i cherish his because in me it bides
my true-love hath my heart and i have his
and you my love as high as heaven above
yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain
ascend to heaven in honour of my love
and you my love as humble and as low
as are the deepest bottoms of the main
whereso'er you were with you my love should go
my love should shine on you like to the sun
and look upon you with ten thousand eyes
till heaven wax'd blind and till the world were done
whereso'er you are my heart shall truly love you
o stay and hear your true-love's coming
that can sing both high and low
trip no further pretty sweeting
journeys end in lovers' meeting--
every wise man's son doth know
present mirth hath present laughter
what's to come is still unsure
in delay there lies no plenty --
then come kiss me sweet-and-twenty
youth's a stuff will not endure
and dick the shepherd blows his nail
and tom bears logs into the hall
and milk comes frozen home in pail
when blood is nipt and ways be foul
then nightly sings the staring owl
tuwhoo
tuwhit tuwhoo a merry note
while greasy joan doth keel the pot
and coughing drowns the parson's saw
and birds sit brooding in the snow
and marian's nose looks red and raw
when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl--
then nightly sings the staring owl
tuwhoo
tuwhit tuwhoo a merry note
while greasy joan doth keel the pot
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death's second self that seals up all in rest
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the deathbed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourish'd by
to love that well which thou must leave ere long
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
for precious friends hid in death's dateless night
and weep afresh love's long-since-cancell'd woe
and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
the sad account of fore-bemoan d moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
all losses are restored and sorrows end
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd
crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
and delves the parallels in beauty's brow
feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgement making
in sleep a king but waking no such matter
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmov d cold and to temptation slow --
and husband nature's riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
say nay say nay for shame
to save thee from the blame
of all my grief and grame
and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay
that hath loved thee so long
in wealth and woe among
and is thy heart so strong
as for to leave me thus
say nay say nay
that hath given thee my heart
never for to depart
neither for pain nor smart
and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay
and have no more pity
of him that loveth thee
alas thy cruelty
and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay
in the merry month of may
sitting in a pleasant shade
which a grove of myrtles made
beasts did leap and birds did sing
trees did grow and plants did spring
every thing did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
lean'd her breast against a thorn
and there sung the dolefullest ditty
that to hear it was great pity
fie fie fie now would she cry
tereu tereu by and by
that to hear her so complain
scarce i could from tears refrain
for her griefs so lively shown
made me think upon mine own
--ah thought i thou mourn'st in vain
none takes pity on thy pain
senseless trees they cannot hear thee
ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee
king pandion he is dead
all thy friends are lapp'd in lead
all thy fellow birds do sing
careless of thy sorrowing
even so poor bird like thee
none alive will pity me
brother to death in silent darkness born
relieve my anguish and restore the light
with dark forgetting of my care return
the shipwreck of my ill adventured youth
let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn
without the torment of the night's untruth
to model forth the passions of the morrow
never let rising sun approve you liars
to add more grief to aggravate my sorrow
and never wake to feel the day's disdain
that so sweetly were forsworn
and those eyes the break of day
lights that do mislead the morn
but my kisses bring again
bring again--
seals of love but seal'd in vain
seal'd in vain
nay i have done you get no more of me
and i am glad yea glad with all my heart
that thus so cleanly i myself can free
and when we meet at any time again
be it not seen in either of our brows
that we one jot of former love retain
when his pulse failing passion speechless lies
when faith is kneeling by his bed of death
and innocence is closing up his eyes
from death to life thou might'st him yet recover
with thy green mother in some shady grove
when immelodious winds but made thee move
and birds their ramage did on thee bestow
which wont in such harmonious strains to flow
is reft from earth to tune those spheres above
what art thou but a harbinger of woe
but orphan's wailings to the fainting ear
each stroke a sigh each sound draws forth a tear
for which be silent as in woods before
like widow'd turtle still her loss complain
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
love's eye is not so true as all men's no
that is so vex'd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find
scorch d the fruits in vale and mountain
philon the shepherd late forgot
sitting beside a crystal fountain
in shadow of a green oak tree
upon his pipe this song play'd he
adieu love adieu love untrue love
untrue love untrue love adieu love
your mind is light soon lost for new love
i was your heart your soul and treasure
and evermore you sobb'd and sigh'd
burning in flames beyond all measure
--three days endured your love to me
and it was lost in other three
adieu love adieu love untrue love
untrue love untrue love adieu love
your mind is light soon lost for new love
to whom your heart was soon enchain d
full soon your love was leapt from me
full soon my place he had obtain d
soon came a third your love to win
and we were out and he was in
adieu love adieu love untrue love
untrue love untrue love adieu love
your mind is light soon lost for new love
that you your mind so soon remov d
before that i the leisure had
to choose you for my best belov d
for all your love was past and done
two days before it was begun --
adieu love adieu love untrue love
untrue love untrue love adieu love
your mind is light soon lost for new love
or that their love were firm not fickle still
i would not marvel that they make men bond
by service long to purchase their good will
but when i see how frail those creatures are
i muse that men forget themselves so far
how oft from phoebus they do flee to pan
unsettled still like haggards wild they range
these gentle birds that fly from man to man
who would not scorn and shake them from the fist
and let them fly fair fools which way they list
to pass the time when nothing else can please
and train them to our lure with subtle oath
till weary of their wiles ourselves we ease
and then we say when we their fancy try
to play with fools o what a fool was i
thou art not so unkind
as man's ingratitude
thy tooth is not so keen
because thou art not seen
although thy breath be rude
heigh ho sing heigh ho unto the green holly
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
then heigh ho the holly
this life is most jolly
that dost not bite so nigh
as benefits forgot
though thou the waters warp
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remember'd not
heigh ho sing heigh ho unto the green holly
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
then heigh ho the holly
this life is most jolly
i do detest my life
and with lamenting cries
peace to my soul to bring
oft call that prince which here doth monarchise
--but he grim grinning king
who caitiffs scorns and doth the blest surprise
late having deck'd with beauty's rose his tomb
disdains to crop a weed and will not come
and in sad cypres let me be laid
fly away fly away breath
i am slain by a fair cruel maid
my shroud of white stuck all with yew
o prepare it
my part of death no one so true
did share it
on my black coffin let there be strown
not a friend not a friend greet
my poor corpse where my bones shall thrown
a thousand thousand sighs to save
lay me o where
sad true lover never find my grave
to weep there
nor the furious winter's rages
thou thy worldly task hast done
home art gone and ta'en thy wages
golden lads and girls all must
as chimney-sweepers come to dust
thou art past the tyrant's stroke
care no more to clothe and eat
to thee the reed is as the oak
the sceptre learning physic must
all follow this and come to dust
nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone
fear not slander censure rash
thou hast finish'd joy and moan
all lovers young all lovers must
consign to thee and come to dust
of his bones are coral made
those are pearls that were his eyes
nothing of him that doth fade
but doth suffer a sea-change
into something rich and strange
sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
hark now i hear them --
ding dong bell
since o'er shady groves they hover
and with leaves and flowers do cover
the friendless bodies of unburied men
call unto his funeral dole
the ant the field-mouse and the mole
to rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm
and when gay tombs are robb'd sustain no harm
but keep the wolf far thence that's foe to men
for with his nails he'll dig them up again
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re-survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceas d lover
and though they be outstripp'd by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
had my friend's muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
theirs for their style i'll read his for his love
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
and mock you with me after i am gone
or in the heart or in the head
how begot how nourish d
reply reply
it is engender'd in the eyes
with gazing fed and fancy dies
in the cradle where it lies
let us all ring fancy's knell
i'll begin it --ding dong bell
--ding dong bell
at cards for kisses cupid paid
he stakes his quiver bow and arrows
his mother's doves and team of sparrows
loses them too then down he throws
the coral of his lip the rose
growing on's cheek but none knows how
with these the crystal of his brow
and then the dimple on his chin
all these did my campaspe win
at last he set her both his eyes--
she won and cupid blind did rise
o love has she done this to thee
what shall alas become of me
with night we banish sorrow
sweet air blow soft mount larks aloft
to give my love good-morrow
wings from the wind to please her mind
notes from the lark i'll borrow
bird prune thy wing nightingale sing
to give my love good-morrow
to give my love good-morrow
notes from them both i'll borrow
sing birds in every furrow
and from each hill let music shrill
give my fair love good-morrow
blackbird and thrush in every bush
stare linnet and cock-sparrow
you pretty elves amongst yourselves
sing my fair love good-morrow
to give my love good-morrow
sing birds in every furrow
sweet-breathing zephyrus did softly play--
a gentle spirit that lightly did delay
hot titan's beams which then did glister fair
when i whom sullen care
through discontent of my long fruitless stay
in princes' court and expectation vain
of idle hopes which still do fly away
like empty shadows did afflict my brain
walk'd forth to ease my pain
along the shore of silver-streaming thames
whose rutty bank the which his river hems
was painted all with variable flowers
and all the meads adorn'd with dainty gems
fit to deck maidens' bowers
and crown their paramours
against the bridal day which is not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
a flock of nymphs i chanc d to espy
all lovely daughters of the flood thereby
with goodly greenish locks all loose untied
as each had been a bride
and each one had a little wicker basket
made of fine twigs entrail d curiously
in which they gather'd flowers to fill their flasket
and with fine fingers cropt full feateously
the tender stalks on high
of every sort which in that meadow grew
they gather'd some the violet pallid blue
the little daisy that at evening closes
the virgin lily and the primrose true
with store of vermeil roses
to deck their bridegrooms' posies
against the bridal day which was not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
come softly swimming down along the lee
two fairer birds i yet did never see
the snow which doth the top of pindus strow
did never whiter show
nor jove himself when he a swan would be
for love of leda whiter did appear
yet leda was they say as white as he
yet not so white as these nor nothing near
so purely white they were
that even the gentle stream the which them bare
seem'd foul to them and bade his billows spare
to wet their silken feathers lest they might
soil their fair plumes with water not so fair
and mar their beauties bright
that shone as heaven's light
against their bridal day which was not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
ran all in haste to see that silver brood
as they came floating on the crystal flood
whom when they saw they stood amaz d still
their wondering eyes to fill
them seem'd they never saw a sight so fair
of fowls so lovely that they sure did deem
them heavenly born or to be that same pair
which through the sky draw venus' silver team
for sure they did not seem
to be begot of any earthly seed
but rather angels or of angels' breed
yet were they bred of summer's heat they say
in sweetest season when each flower and weed
the earth did fresh array
so fresh they seem'd as day
even as their bridal day which was not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
great store of flowers the honour of the field
that to the sense did fragrant odours yield
all which upon those goodly birds they threw
and all the waves did strew
that like old peneus' waters they did seem
when down along by pleasant tempe's shore
scatter'd with flowers through thessaly they stream
that they appear through lilies' plenteous store
like a bride's chamber-floor
two of those nymphs meanwhile two garlands bound
of freshest flowers which in that mead they found
the which presenting all in trim array
their snowy foreheads therewithal they crown'd
whilst one did sing this lay
prepar'd against that day
against their bridal day which was not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
and heaven's glory whom this happy hour
doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower
joy may you have and gentle hearts content
of your loves complement
and let fair venus that is queen of love
with her heart-quelling son upon you smile
whose smile they say hath virtue to remove
all love's dislike and friendship's faulty guile
for ever to assoil
let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord
and bless d plenty wait upon your board
and let your bed with pleasures chaste abound
that fruitful issue may to you afford
which may your foes confound
and make your joys redound
upon your bridal day which is not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
to her redoubled that her undersong
which said their bridal day should not be long
and gentle echo from the neighbour ground
their accents did resound
so forth those joyous birds did pass along
adown the lee that to them murmur'd low
as he would speak but that he lack'd a tongue
yet did by signs his glad affection show
making his stream run slow
and all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
'gan flock about these twain that did excel
the rest so far as cynthia doth shend
the lesser stars so they enrang d well
did on those two attend
and their best service lend
against their wedding day which was not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
to merry london my most kindly nurse
that to me gave this life's first native source
though from another place i take my name
an house of ancient fame
there when they came whereas those bricky towers
the which on thames' broad ag d back do ride
where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
there whilome wont the templar-knights to bide
till they decay'd through pride
next whereunto there stands a stately place
where oft i gain d gifts and goodly grace
of that great lord which therein wont to dwell
whose want too well now feels my friendless case
but ah here fits not well
old woes but joys to tell
against the bridal day which is not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
great england's glory and the world's wide wonder
whose dreadful name late thro' all spain did thunder
and hercules' two pillars standing near
did make to quake and fear
fair branch of honour flower of chivalry
that fillest england with thy triumphs' fame
joy have thou of thy noble victory
and endless happiness of thine own name
that promiseth the same
that through thy prowess and victorious arms
thy country may be freed from foreign harms
and great eliza's glorious name may ring
through all the world fill'd with thy wide alarms
which some brave muse may sing
to ages following
upon the bridal day which is not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
like radiant hesper when his golden hair
in th' ocean billows he hath bath d fair
descended to the river's open viewing
with a great train ensuing
above the rest were goodly to be seen
two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
beseeming well the bower of any queen
with gifts of wit and ornaments of nature
fit for so goodly stature
that like the twins of jove they seem'd in sight
which deck the baldric of the heavens bright
they two forth pacing to the river's side
received those two fair brides their love's delight
which at th' appointed tide
each one did make his bride
against their bridal day which is not long
sweet thames run softly till i end my song
o sweet content
art thou rich yet is thy mind perplex d
o punishment
dost thou laugh to see how fools are vex d
to add to golden numbers golden numbers
o sweet content o sweet o sweet content
work apace apace apace apace
honest labour bears a lovely face
then hey nonny nonny hey nonny nonny
o sweet content
swimm'st thou in wealth yet sink'st in thine own tears
o punishment
then he that patiently want's burden bears
no burden bears but is a king a king
o sweet content o sweet o sweet content
work apace apace apace apace
honest labour bears a lovely face
then hey nonny nonny hey nonny nonny
is like a bubble blown up in the air
by sporting children's breath
who chase it everywhere
and strive who can most motion it bequeath
and though it sometimes seem of its own might
like to an eye of gold to be fix'd there
and firm to hover in that empty height
that only is because it is so light
--but in that pomp it doth not long appear
for when 'tis most admir d in a thought
because it erst was nought it turns to nought
fool'd by those rebel powers that thee array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more --
and death once dead there's no more dying then
less than a span
in his conception wretched from the womb
so to the tomb
curst from his cradle and brought up to years
with cares and fears
who then to frail mortality shall trust
but limns on water or but writes in dust
what life is best
courts are but only superficial schools
to dandle fools
the rural parts are turn'd into a den
of savage men
and where's a city from foul vice so free
but may be term'd the worst of all the three
or pains his head
those that live single take it for a curse
or do things worse
some would have children those that have them moan
or wish them gone
what is it then to have or have no wife
but single thraldom or a double strife
is a disease
to cross the seas to any foreign soil
peril and toil
wars with their noise affright us when they cease
we are worse in peace --
what then remains but that we still should cry
for being born or being born to die
if we the sheets and leaves could turn with care
of him who it corrects and did it frame
we clear might read the art and wisdom rare
his providence extending everywhere
his justice which proud rebels doth not spare
in every page no period of the same
well pleased with colour'd vellum leaves of gold
fair dangling ribbands leaving what is best
on the great writer's sense ne'er taking hold
it is some picture on the margin wrought
is this the justice which on earth we find
is this that firm decree which all doth bind
are these your influences powers above
blind fortune blindly most their friend doth prove
and they who thee poor idle virtue love
ply like a feather toss'd by storm and wind
why should best minds groan under most distress
or why should pride humility make thrall
and injuries the innocent oppress
when good may have as well as bad their prime
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabl d
and folly doctor-like controlling skill
and simple truth miscall'd simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill --
save that to die i leave my love alone
girt with rough skins hies to the deserts wild
among that savage brood the woods forth bring
which he more harmless found than man and mild
with honey that from virgin hives distill'd
parch'd body hollow eyes some uncouth thing
made him appear long since from earth exiled
on god with me amidst these deserts mourn
repent repent and from old errors turn
--who listen'd to his voice obey'd his cry
rung from their flinty caves repent repent
century contains the close of our early poetical style and the
commencement of the modern in dryden we see the first master of the
new in milton whose genius dominates here as shakespeare's in the
former book --the crown and consummation of the early period their
splendid odes are far in advance of any prior attempts spenser's
excepted they exhibit the wider and grander range which years and
experience and the struggles of the time conferred on poetry poetry now
gave expression to political feeling to religious thought to a high
philosophic statesmanship in writers such as marvell herbert and
wotton whilst in marvell and milton again we find the first noble
attempts at pure description of nature destined in our own ages to be
continued and equalled meanwhile the poetry of simple passion although
before often deformed by verbal fancies and conceits of thought
and afterward by levity and an artificial tone --produced in herrick and
waller some charming pieces of more finished art than the elizabethan
until in the courtly compliments of sedley it seems to exhaust itself
and lie almost dormant for the hundred years between the days of wither
and suckling and the days of burns and cowper --that the change from our
early style to the modern brought with it at first a loss of nature and
simplicity is undeniable yet the far bolder and wider scope which
poetry took between and and the successful efforts then made
to gain greater clearness in expression in their results have been no
slight compensation
wherein the son of heaven's eternal king
of wedded maid and virgin mother born
our great redemption from above did bring
for so the holy sages once did sing
that he our deadly forfeit should release
and with his father work us a perpetual peace
and that far-beaming blaze of majesty
wherewith he wont at heaven's high council-table
to sit the midst of trinal unity
he laid aside and here with us to be
forsook the courts of everlasting day
and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay
afford a present to the infant god
hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain
to welcome him to this his new abode
now while the heaven by the sun's team untrod
hath took no print of the approaching light
and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright
the star-led wizards haste with odours sweet
o run prevent them with thy humble ode
and lay it lowly at his blessed feet
have thou the honour first thy lord to greet
and join thy voice unto the angel quire
from out his secret altar touch'd with hallow'd fire
while the heaven-born child
all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies
nature in awe to him
had doff'd her gaudy trim
with her great master so to sympathise
it was no season then for her
to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour
she woos the gentle air
to hide her guilty front with innocent snow
and on her naked shame
pollute with sinful blame
the saintly veil of maiden white to throw
confounded that her maker's eyes
should look so near upon her foul deformities
sent down the meek-eyed peace
she crown'd with olive green came softly sliding
down through the turning sphere
his ready harbinger
with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing
and waving wide her myrtle wand
she strikes a universal peace through sea and land
was heard the world around
the idle spear and shield were high up hung
the hook d chariot stood
unstain'd with hostile blood
the trumpet spake not to the arm d throng
and kings sat still with awful eye
as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by
wherin the prince of light
his reign of peace upon the earth began
the winds with wonder whist
smoothly the waters kist
whispering new joys to the mild oce n--
who now hath quite forgot to rave
while birds of calm sit brooding on the charm d wave
stand fix'd in steadfast gaze
bending one way their precious influence
and will not take their flight
for all the morning light
or lucifer that often warn'd them thence
but in their glimmering orbs did glow
until their lord himself bespake and bid them go
had given day her room
the sun himself withheld his wonted speed
and hid his head for shame
as his inferior flame
the new-enlightn'd world no more should need
he saw a greater sun appear
then his bright throne or burning axletree could bear
or ere the point of dawn
sate simply chatting in a rustic row
full little thought they then
that the mighty pan
was kindly come to live with them below
perhaps their loves or else their sheep
was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep
their hearts and ears did greet
as never was by mortal finger strook--
divinely-warbled voice
answering the string d noise
as all their souls in blissful rapture took
the air such pleasure loth to lose
with thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close
beneath the hollow round
of cynthia's seat the airy region thrilling
now was almost won
to think her part was done
and that her reign had here its last fulfilling
she knew such harmony alone
could hold all heaven and earth in happier union
a globe of circular light
that with long beams the shamefaced night array'd
the helm d cherubim
and sworded seraphim
are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd
harping in loud and solemn quire
with unexpressive notes to heaven's new-born heir
before was never made
but when of old the sons of morning sung
while the creator great
his constellations set
and the well-balanced world on hinges hung
and cast the dark foundations deep
and bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep
once bless our human ears
if ye have power to touch our senses so
and let your silver chime
move in melodious time
and let the bass of heaven's deep organ blow
and with your ninefold harmony
make up full concert to the angelic symphony
enwrap our fancy long
time will run back and fetch the age of gold
and speckled vanity
will sicken soon and die
and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould
and hell itself will pass away
and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day
will down return to men
orb'd in a rainbow and like glories wearing
mercy will sit between
throned in celestial sheen
with radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering
and heaven as at some festival
will open wide the gates of her high palace hall
this must not yet be so
the babe yet lies in smiling infancy
that on the bitter cross
must redeem our loss
so both himself and us to glorify
yet first to those ychain'd in sleep
the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep
as on mount sinai rang
while the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake
the aged earth agast
with terrour of that blast
shall from the surface to the centre shake
when at the worlds last sessi n
the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne
full and perfect is
but now begins for from this happy day
the old dragon under ground
in straiter limits bound
not half so far casts his usurp d sway
and wroth to see his kingdom fail
swinges the scaly horrour of his folded tail
no voice or hideous hum
runs through the arch d roof in words deceiving
apollo from his shrine
can no more divine
with hollow shriek the steep of delphos leaving
no nightly trance or breath d spell
inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell
and the resounding shore
a voice of weeping heard and loud lament
from haunted spring and dale
edged with poplar pale
the parting genius is with sighing sent
with flower-inwoven tresses torn
the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn
and on the holy hearth
the lars and lemur s moan with midnight plaint
in urns and altars round
a drear and dying sound
affrights the flamens at their service quaint
and the chill marble seems to sweat
while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat
forsake their temples dim
with that twice-batter'd god of palestine
and moon d ashtaroth
heaven's queen and mother both
now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine
the lybic hammon shrinks his horn
in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thammuz mourn
hath left in shadows dread
his burning idol all of blackest hue
in vain with cymbals' ring
they call the grisly king
in dismal dance about the furnace blue
the brutish gods of nile as fast
isis and orus and the dog anubis haste
in memphian grove or green
trampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud
nor can he be at rest
within his sacred chest
naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud
in vain with timbrell'd anthems dark
the sable stol d sorcerers bear his worshipt ark
the dreaded infant's hand
the rays of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn
nor all the gods beside
longer dare abide
nor typhon huge ending in snaky twine
our babe to shew his godhead true
can in his swaddling bands control the damn d crew
curtain'd with cloudy red
pillows his chin upon an orient wave
the flocking shadows pale
troop to the infernal jail
each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave
and the yellow-skirted fays
fly after the night-steeds leaving their moon-loved maze
hath laid her babe to rest
time is our tedious song should here have ending
heavens youngest-teem d star
hath fixed her polish'd car
her sleeping lord with hand-maid lamp attending
and all about the courtly stable
bright-harness'd angels sit in order serviceable
this universal frame began
when nature underneath a heap
of jarring atoms lay
and could not heave her head
the tuneful voice was heard from high
arise ye more than dead
then cold and hot and moist and dry
in order to their stations leap
and music's power obey
from harmony from heavenly harmony
this universal frame began
from harmony to harmony
through all the compass of the notes it ran
the diapason closing full in man
when jubal struck the chorded shell
his listening brethren stood around
and wondering on their faces fell
to worship that celestial sound
less than a god they thought there could not dwell
within the hollow of that shell
that spoke so sweetly and so well
what passion cannot music raise and quell
excites us to arms
with shrill notes of anger
and mortal alarms
the double double double beat
of the thundering drum
cries hark the foes come
charge charge 'tis too late to retreat
in dying notes discovers
the woes of hopeless lovers
whose dirge is whisper'd by the warbling lute
their jealous pangs and desperation
fury frantic indignation
depth of pains and height of passion
for the fair disdainful dame
what human voice can reach
the sacred organ's praise
notes inspiring holy love
notes that wing their heavenly ways
to mend the choirs above
orpheus could lead the savage race
and trees uprooted left their place
sequacious of the lyre
but bright cecilia raised the wonder higher
when to her organ vocal breath was given
an angel heard and straight appear'd--
mistaking earth for heaven
the spheres began to move
and sung the great creator's praise
to all the blest above
so when the last and dreadful hour
this crumbling pageant shall devour
the trumpet shall be heard on high
the dead shall live the living die
and music shall untune the sky
lie scatter'd on the alpine mountains cold
even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
when all our fathers worshipt stocks and stones
who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold
slain by the bloody piemontese that roll'd
mother with infant down the rocks their moans
to heaven their martyr'd blood and ashes sow
o'er all the italian field where still doth sway
the triple tyrant that from these may grow
a hundred-fold who having learnt thy way
early may fly the babylonian woe
must now forsake his muses dear
nor in the shadows sing
his numbers languishing
and oil the unused armour's rust
removing from the wall
the corslet of the hall
in the inglorious arts of peace
but through adventurous war
urg d his active star
breaking the clouds where it was nurst
did thorough his own side
his fiery way divide
the emulous or enemy
and with such to enclose
is more than to oppose
and palaces and temples rent
and caesar's head at last
did through his laurels blast
the face of angry heaven's flame
and if we would speak true
much to the man is due
he lived reserv d and austere
as if he his highest plot
to plant the bergamot
to ruin the great work of time
and cast the kingdoms old
into another mould
and plead the ancient rights in vain--
but those do hold or break
as men are strong or weak
allows of penetration less
and therefore must make room
where greater spirits come
where his were not the deepest scar
and hampton shows what part
he had of wiser art
he wove a net of such a scope
that charles himself might chase
to carisbrook's narrow case
the tragic scaffold might adorn
while round the arm d bands
did clap their bloody hands
upon that memorable scene
but with his keener eye
the axe's edge did try
to vindicate his helpless right
but bow'd his comely head
down as upon a bed
which first assured the forc d power
so when they did design
the capitol's first line
did fright the architects to run
and yet in that the state
foresaw its happy fate
to see themselves in one year tamed
so much one man can do
that does both act and know
and have though overcome confest
how good he is how just
and fit for highest trust
but still in the republic's hand--
how fit he is to sway
that can so well obey
a kingdom for his first year's rents
and what he may forbears
his fame to make it theirs
to lay them at the public's skirt
so when the falcon high
falls heavy from the sky
but on the next green bough to perch
where when he first does lure
the falconer has her sure
while victory his crest does plume
what may not others fear
if thus he crowns each year
to italy an hannibal
and to all states not free
shall climacteric be
within his parti-colour'd mind
but from this valour sad
shrink underneath the plaid--
the english hunter him mistake
nor lay his hounds in near
the caledonian deer
march indefatigably on
and for the last effect
still keep the sword erect
the spirits of the shady night
the same arts that did gain
a power must it maintain
ye myrtles brown with ivy never sere
i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude
and with forced fingers rude
shatter your leaves before the mellowing year
bitter constraint and sad occasion dear
compels me to disturb your season due
for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime
young lycidas and hath not left his peer
who would not sing for lycidas he knew
himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme
he must not float upon his watery bier
unwept and welter to the parching wind
without the meed of some melodious tear
that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring
begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string
hence with denial vain and coy excuse
so may some gentle muse
with lucky words favour my destined urn
and as he passes turn
and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud
fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill
together both ere the high lawns appear'd
under the opening eye-lids of the morn
we drove a-field and both together heard
what time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn
battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night
oft till the star that rose at evening bright
toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel
meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute
temper'd to the oaten flute
rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel
from the glad sound would not be absent long
and old damoetas loved to hear our song
now thou art gone and never must return
thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves
with wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown
and all their echoes mourn
the willows and the hazel copses green
shall now no more be seen
fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays --
as killing as the canker to the rose
or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze
or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear
when first the white-thorn blows
such lycidas thy loss to shepherds' ear
closed o'er the head of your loved lycidas
for neither were ye playing on the steep
where your old bards the famous druids lie
nor on the shaggy top of mona high
nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream
ay me i fondly dream--
had ye been there--for what could that have done
what could the muse herself that orpheus bore
the muse herself for her enchanting son
whom universal nature did lament
when by the rout that made the hideous roar
his gory visage down the stream was sent
down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore
to tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade
and strictly meditate the thankless muse
were it not better done as others use
to sport with amaryllis in the shade
or with the tangles of neaera's hair
fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
that last infirmity of noble mind
to scorn delights and live laborious days
but the fair guerdon when we hope to find
and think to burst out into sudden blaze
comes the blind fury with the abhorr d shears
and slits the thin-spun life but not the praise
phoebus replied and touch'd my trembling ears
fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil
nor in the glistering foil
set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies
but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
and perfect witness of all-judging jove
as he pronounces lastly on each deed
of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed
smooth-sliding mincius crown'd with vocal reeds
that strain i heard was of a higher mood
but now my oat proceeds
and listens to the herald of the sea
that came in neptune's plea
he ask'd the waves and ask'd the felon winds
what hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain
and question'd every gust of rugged wings
that blows from off each beak d promontory
they knew not of his story
and sage hippotad s their answer brings
that not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd
the air was calm and on the level brine
sleek panop with all her sisters play'd
it was that fatal and perfidious bark
built in the eclipse and rigg'd with curses dark
that sunk so low that sacred head of thine
his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge
inwrought with figures dim and on the edge
like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe
ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge
last came and last did go
the pilot of the galilean lake
two massy keys he bore of metals twain
the golden opes the iron shuts amain
he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake
how well could i have spared for thee young swain
enow of such as for their bellies' sake
creep and intrude and climb into the fold
of other care they little reckoning make
than how to scramble at the shearers' feast
and shove away the worthy bidden guest
blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold
a sheep-hook or have learn'd aught else the least
that to the faithful herdman's art belongs
what recks it them what need they they are sped
and when they list their lean and flashy songs
grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw
the hungry sheep look up and are not fed
but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw
rot inwardly and foul contagion spread
besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
daily devours apace and nothing said
--but that two-handed engine at the door
stands ready to smite once and smite no more
that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse
and call the vales and bid them hither cast
their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues
ye valleys low where the mild whispers use
of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks
on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks
throw hither all your quaint enamell'd eyes
that on the green turf suck the honey'd showers
and purple all the ground with vernal flowers
bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies
the tufted crow-toe and pale jessamine
the white pink and the pansy freak'd with jet
the glowing violet
the musk-rose and the well-attired woodbine
with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head
and every flower that sad embroidery wears
bid amaranthus all his beauty shed
and daffodillies fill their cups with tears
to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies
for so to interpose a little ease
let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise
ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
wash far away --where'er thy bones are hurl'd
whether beyond the stormy hebrides
where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
visitest the bottom of the monstrous world
or whether thou to our moist vows denied
sleep'st by the fable of bellerus old
where the great vision of the guarded mount
looks toward namancos and bayona's hold
--look homeward angel now and melt with ruth
--and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth
for lycidas your sorrow is not dead
sunk though he be beneath the watery floor
so sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed
and yet anon repairs his drooping head
and tricks his beams and with new-spangled ore
flames in the forehead of the morning sky
so lycidas sunk low but mounted high
through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves
where other groves and other streams along
with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves
and hears the unexpressive nuptial song
in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love
there entertain him all the saints above
in solemn troops and sweet societies
that sing and singing in their glory move
and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes
now lycidas the shepherds weep no more
henceforth thou art the genius of the shore
in thy large recompense and shalt be good
to all that wander in that perilous flood
while the still morn went out with sandals gray
he touch'd the tender stops of various quills
with eager thought warbling his doric lay
and now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills
and now was dropt into the western bay
at last he rose and twitch'd his mantle blue
to-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new
what a change of flesh is here
think how many royal bones
sleep within these heaps of stones
here they lie had realms and lands
who now want strength to stir their hands
where from their pulpits seal'd with dust
they preach in greatness is no trust
here's an acre sown indeed
with the richest royallest seed
that the earth did e'er suck in
since the first man died for sin
here the bones of birth have cried
though gods they were as men they died
here are sands ignoble things
dropt from the ruin'd sides of kings
here's a world of pomp and state
buried in dust once dead by fate
proclaim how wide your empires are
though you bind-in every shore
and your triumphs reach as far
as night and day
yet you proud monarchs must obey
and mingle with forgotten ashes when
death calls ye to the crowd of common men
each able to undo mankind
death's servile emissaries are
nor to these alone confined
he hath at will
more quaint and subtle ways to kill
a smile or kiss as he will use the art
shall have the cunning skill to break a heart
are shadows not substantial things
there is no armour against fate
death lays his icy hand on kings
sceptre and crown
must tumble down
and in the dust be equal made
with the poor crooked scythe and spade
and plant fresh laurels where they kill
but their strong nerves at last must yield
they tame but one another still
early or late
they stoop to fate
and must give up their murmuring breath
when they pale captives creep to death
then boast no more your mighty deeds
upon death's purple altar now
see where the victor-victim bleeds
your heads must come
to the cold tomb
only the actions of the just
smell sweet and blossom in their dust
whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize
if deed of honour did thee ever please
guard them and him within protect from harms
that call fame on such gentle acts as these
and he can spread thy name o'er lands and seas
whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms
the great emathian conqueror bid spare
the house of pindarus when temple and tower
went to the ground and the repeated air
of sad electra's poet had the power
to save the athenian walls from ruin bare
ere half my days in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless though my soul more bent
my true account lest he returning chide --
doth god exact day-labour light denied
i fondly ask --but patience to prevent
either man's work or his own gifts who best
bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state
and post o'er land and ocean without rest --
they also serve who only stand and wait
that serveth not another's will
whose armour is his honest thought
and simple truth his utmost skill
whose soul is still prepared for death
not tied unto the world by care
of public fame or private breath
or vice who never understood
how deepest wounds are given by praise
nor rules of state but rules of good
whose conscience is his strong retreat
whose state can neither flatterers feed
nor ruin make accusers great
more of his grace than gifts to lend
and entertains the harmless day
with a well-chosen book or friend
of hope to rise or fear to fall
lord of himself though not of lands
and having nothing yet hath all
in bulk doth make man better be
or standing long an oak three hundred year
to fall a log at last dry bald and sere
a lily of a day
is fairer far in may
although it fall and die that night--
it was the plant and flower of light
in small proportions we just beauties see
and in short measures life may perfect be
having a glass of blessings standing by
let us said he pour on him all we can
let the world's riches which dispers d lie
contract into a span
then beauty flow'd then wisdom honour pleasure
when almost all was out god made a stay
perceiving that alone of all his treasure
rest in the bottom lay
bestow this jewel also on my creature
he would adore my gifts instead of me
and rest in nature not the god of nature
so both should losers be
but keep them with repining restlessness
let him be rich and weary that at least
if goodness lead him not yet weariness
may toss him to my breast
shined in my angel-infancy
before i understood this place
appointed for my second race
or taught my soul to fancy aught
but a white celestial thought
when yet i had not walk'd above
a mile or two from my first love
could see a glimpse of his bright face
when on some gilded cloud or flower
my gazing soul would dwell an hour
and in those weaker glories spy
some shadows of eternity
before i taught my tongue to wound
my conscience with a sinful sound
or had the black art to dispense
a several sin to every sense
but felt through all this fleshly dress
bright shoots of everlastingness
and tread again that ancient track
that i might once more reach that plain
where first i left my glorious train
from whence th' enlighten'd spirit sees
that shady city of palm trees
but ah my soul with too much stay
is drunk and staggers in the way --
some men a forward motion love
but i by backward steps would move
and when this dust falls to the urn
in that state i came return
now that the fields are dank and ways are mire
where shall we sometimes meet and by the fire
help waste a sullen day what may be won
on smoother till favonius re-inspire
the frozen earth and cloth in fresh attire
the lily and rose that neither sow'd nor spun
of attic taste with wine whence we may rise
to hear the lute well touch'd or artful voice
he who of those delights can judge and spare
to interpose them oft is not unwise
of british themis with no mean applause
pronounced and in his volumes taught our laws
which others at their bar so often wrench
in mirth that after no repenting draws
let euclid rest and archimedes pause
and what the swede intends and what the french
toward solid good what leads the nearest way
for other things mild heaven a time ordains
that with superfluous burden loads the day
and when god sends a cheerful hour refrains
now the sun is laid to sleep
seated in thy silver chair
state in wonted manner keep
hesperus entreats thy light
goddess excellently bright
dare itself to interpose
cynthia's shining orb was made
heaven to clear when day did close
bless us then with wish d sight
goddess excellently bright
and thy crystal-shining quiver
give unto the flying hart
space to breathe how short soever
thou that mak'st a day of night
goddess excellently bright
that not impossible she
that shall command my heart and me
lock'd up from mortal eye
in shady leaves of destiny
of studied fate stand forth
and teach her fair steps to our earth
idea take a shrine
of crystal flesh through which to shine
bespeak her to my blisses
and be ye call'd my absent kisses
that owes not all its duty
to gaudy tire or glist'ring shoe-tie
taffata or tissue can
or rampant feather or rich fan
by its own beauty drest
and can alone command the rest
out of no other shop
than what nature's white hand sets ope
of sweet discourse whose powers
can crown old winter's head with flowers
can make day's forehead bright
or give down to the wings of night
open suns shady bowers
'bove all nothing within that lowers
no part of their good morrow
from a fore-spent night of sorrow
of darkness by the light
of a clear mind are day all night
a challenge to his end
and when it comes say welcome friend
of worth may leave her poor
of wishes and i wish--no more
that her whose radiant brows
weave them a garland of my vows
what these lines wish to see
i seek no further it is she
lo i unclothe and clear
my wishes' cloudy character
shall fix my flying wishes
and determine them to kisses
my fancies fly before ye
be ye my fictions --but her story
and over the waves
under the fountains
and under the graves
under floods that are deepest
which neptune obey
over rocks that are steepest
love will find out the way
for the glow-worm to lie
when there is no space
for receipt of a fly
when the midge dares not venture
lest herself fast she lay
if love come he will enter
and will find out his way
a child for his might
or you may deem him
a coward from his flight
but if she whom love doth honour
be conceal'd from the day
set a thousand guards upon her
love will find out the way
by having him confined
and some do suppose him
poor thing to be blind
but if ne'er so close ye wall him
do the best that you may
blind love if so ye call him
will find out his way
to stoop to your fist
or you may inveigle
the phoenix of the east
the lioness ye may move her
to give o'er her prey
but you'll ne'er stop a lover
he will find out his way
as unconcern'd as when
your infant beauty could beget
no happiness or pain
when i the dawn used to admire
and praised the coming day
i little thought the rising fire
would take my rest away
like metals in a mine
age from no face takes more away
than youth conceal'd in thine
but as your charms insensibly
to their perfection prest
so love as unperceived did fly
and center'd in my breast
while cupid at my heart
still as his mother favour'd you
threw a new flaming dart
each gloried in their wanton part
to make a lover he
employ'd the utmost of his art--
to make a beauty she
old time is still a-flying
and this same flower that smiles to-day
to-morrow will be dying
the higher he's a-getting
the sooner will his race be run
and nearer he's to setting
when youth and blood are warmer
but being spent the worse and worst
times still succeed the former
and while ye may go marry
for having lost but once your prime
you may for ever tarry
that from the nunnery
of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
to war and arms i fly
the first foe in the field
and with a stronger faith embrace
a sword a horse a shield
as you too shalt adore
i could not love thee dear so much
loved i not honour more
which poorly satisfy our eyes
more by your number than your light
you common people of the skies
what are you when the moon shall rise
by your pure purple mantles known
like the proud virgins of the year
as if the spring were all your own --
what are you when the rose is blown
that warble forth dame nature's lays
thinking your passions understood
by your weak accents what's your praise
when philomel her voice doth raise
in sweetness of her looks and mind
by virtue first then choice a queen
tell me if she were not design'd
th' eclipse and glory of her kind
of england's council and her treasury
who lived in both unstain'd with gold or fee
and left them both more in himself content
broke him as that dishonest victory
at chaeronia fatal to liberty
kill'd with report that old man eloquent --
wherein your father flourish'd yet by you
madam methinks i see him living yet
that all both judge you to relate them true
and to possess them honour'd margaret
a crystal brow the moon's despair
nor the snow's daughter a white hand
nor mermaid's yellow pride of hair
your lips that seem on roses fed
your breasts where cupid tumbling lies
nor sleeps for kissing of his bed --
like hebe's in her ruddiest hours
a breath that softer music speaks
than summer winds a-wooing flowers
coral beneath the ocean-stream
whose brink when your adventurer slips
full oft he perisheth on them
that wave hot youth to fields of blood
did helen's breast though ne'er so soft
do greece or ilium any good
poison can breathe that erst perfumed
there's many a white hand holds an urn
with lovers hearts to dust consumed
they are but empty cells for pride
he who the syren's hair would win
is mostly strangled in the tide
a tender heart a loyal mind
which with temptation i would trust
yet never link'd with error find --
could pour my secret heart of woes
like the care-burthen'd honey-fly
that hides his murmurs in the rose --
so indefeasible might be
that when my spirit wonn'd above
hers could not stay for sympathy
or a coral lip admires
or from star-like eyes doth seek
fuel to maintain his fires
as old time makes these decay
so his flames must waste away
gentle thoughts and calm desires
hearts with equal love combined
kindle never-dying fires --
where these are not i despise
lovely cheeks or lips or eyes
which starlike sparkle in their skies
nor be you proud that you can see
all hearts your captives yours yet free
be you not proud of that rich hair
which wantons with the lovesick air
whenas that ruby which you wear
sunk from the tip of your soft ear
will last to be a precious stone
when all your world of beauty's gone
tell her that wastes her time and me
that now she knows
when i resemble her to thee
how sweet and fair she seems to be
and shuns to have her graces spied
that hadst thou sprung
in deserts where no men abide
thou must have uncommended died
of beauty from the light retired
bid her come forth
suffer herself to be desired
and not blush so to be admired
the common fate of all things rare
may read in thee
how small a part of time they share
that are so wondrous sweet and fair
and i will pledge with mine
or leave a kiss but in the cup
and i'll not look for wine
the thirst that from the soul doth rise
doth ask a drink divine
but might i of jove's nectar sup
i would not change for thine
not so much honouring thee
as giving it a hope that there
it could not wither'd be
but thou thereon didst only breathe
and sent'st it back to me
since when it grows and smells i swear
not of itself but thee
where roses and white lilies blow
a heavenly paradise is that place
wherein all pleasant fruits do grow
there cherries grow that none may buy
till cherry-ripe themselves do cry
of orient pearl a double row
which when her lovely laughter shows
they look like rose-buds fill'd with snow
yet them no peer nor prince can buy
till cherry-ripe themselves do cry
her brows like bended bows do stand
threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill
all that approach with eye or hand
these sacred cherries to come nigh
--till cherry-ripe themselves do cry
kindles in clothes a wantonness --
a lawn about the shoulders thrown
into a fine distracti n --
an erring lace which here and there
enthrals the crimson stomacher --
a cuff neglectful and thereby
ribbands to flow confusedly --
a winning wave deserving note
in the tempestuous petticoat --
a careless shoe-string in whose tie
i see a wild civility --
do more bewitch me than when art
is too precise in every part
then then methinks how sweetly flows
that liquefaction of her clothes
that brave vibration each way free
o how that glittering taketh me
it doth so well become her
for every season she hath dressings fit
for winter spring and summer
no beauty she doth miss
when all her robes are on
but beauty's self she is
when all her robes are gone
shall now my joyful temples bind
no monarch but would give his crown
his arms might do what this has done
the pale which held that lovely deer
my joy my grief my hope my love
did all within this circle move
dwelt all that's good and all that's fair
give me but what this ribband bound
take all the rest the sun goes round
thy protestant to be
or bid me love and i will give
a loving heart to thee
a heart as sound and free
as in the whole world thou canst find
that heart i'll give to thee
to honour thy decree
or bid it languish quite away
and 't shall do so for thee
while i have eyes to see
and having none yet i will keep
a heart to weep for thee
under that cypress tree
or bid me die and i will dare
e'en death to die for thee
the very eyes of me
and hast command of every part
to live and die for thee
for my pleasing eye or face
nor for any outward part
no nor for a constant heart --
for these may fail or turn to ill
so thou and i shall sever
keep therefore a true woman's eye
and love me still but know not why--
so hast thou the same reason still
to doat upon me ever
or better than the rest
for i would change each hour like them
were not my heart at rest
by every thought i have
thy face i only care to see
thy heart i only crave
in thy dear self i find--
for the whole sex can but afford
the handsome and the kind
and still make love anew
when change itself can give no more
'tis easy to be true
hovers within my gates
and my divine althea brings
to whisper at the grates
when i lie tangled in her hair
and fetter'd to her eye
the birds that wanton in the air
know no such liberty
with no allaying thames
our careless heads with roses crown'd
our hearts with loyal flames
when thirsty grief in wine we steep
when healths and draughts go free--
fishes that tipple in the deep
know no such liberty
with shriller throat shall sing
the sweetness mercy majesty
and glories of my king
when i shall voice aloud how good
he is how great should be
enlarg d winds that curl the flood
know no such liberty
nor iron bars a cage
minds innocent and quiet take
that for an hermitage
if i have freedom in my love
and in my soul am free
angels alone that soar above
enjoy such liberty
away from thee
or that when i am gone
you or i were alone
then my lucasta might i crave
pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave
our faith and troth
like separated souls
all time and space controls
above the highest sphere we meet
unseen unknown and greet as angels greet
our after-fate
and are alive i' the skies
if thus our lips and eyes
can speak like spirits unconfined
in heaven their earthy bodies left behind
prythee why so pale
will if looking well can't move her
looking ill prevail
prythee why so pale
prythee why so mute
will when speaking well can't win her
saying nothing do't
prythee why so mute
this cannot take her
if of herself she will not love
nothing can make her
the d----l take her
and tell thy silent master's humble tale
in sounds that may prevail
sounds that gentle thoughts inspire
though so exalted she
and i so lowly be
tell her such different notes make all thy harmony
and though the moving hand approach not near
themselves with awful fear
a kind of numerous trembling make
now all thy forces try
now all thy charms apply
revenge upon her ear the conquests of her eye
is useless here since thou art only found
to cure but not to wound
and she to wound but not to cure
too weak too wilt thou prove
my passion to remove
physic to other ills thou'rt nourishment to love
for thou canst never tell my humble tale
in sounds that will prevail
nor gentle thoughts in her inspire
all thy vain mirth lay by
bid thy strings silent lie
sleep sleep again my lyre and let thy master die
die because a woman's fair
or my cheeks make pale with care
'cause another's rosy are
be she fairer than the day
or the flowery meads in may--
if she be not so to me
what care i how fair she be
'cause i see a woman kind
or a well dispos d nature
join d with a lovely feature
be she meeker kinder than
turtle-dove or pelican
if she be not so to me
what care i how kind she be
me to perish for her love
or her merit's value known
make me quite forget my own
be she with that goodness blest
which may gain her name of best
if she be not such to me
what care i how good she be
shall i play the fool and die
those that bear a noble mind
where they want of riches find
think what with them they would do
who without them dare to woo
and unless that mind i see
what care i how great she be
i will ne'er the more despair
if she love me this believe
i will die ere she shall grieve
if she slight me when i woo
i can scorn and let her go
for if she be not for me
what care i for whom she be
as short as are the nights
wherein you spend your folly
there's naught in this life sweet
if men were wise to see't
but only melancholy
o sweetest melancholy
welcome folded arms and fix d eyes
a sigh that piercing mortifies
a look that's fasten'd to the ground
a tongue chain'd up without a sound
fountain-heads and pathless groves
places which pale passion loves
moonlight walks when all the fowls
are warmly housed save bats and owls
a midnight bell a parting groan
these are the sounds we feed upon
then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley
nothing's so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy
as in that well-remember'd night
when first thy mystic braid was wove
and first my agnes whisper'd love
the torrid zone of this wild breast
whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell
with the first sin that peopled hell
a breast whose blood's a troubled ocean
each throb the earthquake's wild commotion
o if such clime thou canst endure
yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure
what conquest o'er each erring thought
of that fierce realm had agnes wrought
i had not wander'd far and wide
with such an angel for my guide
nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me
if she had lived and lived to love me
to me one savage hunting scene
my sole delight the headlong race
and frantic hurry of the chase
to start pursue and bring to bay
rush in drag down and rend my prey
then--from the carcase turn away
mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed
and soothed each wound which pride inflamed --
yes god and man might now approve me
if thou hadst lived and lived to love me
and waly waly down the brae
and waly waly yon burn-side
where i and my love wont to gae
i leant my back unto an aik
i thought it was a trusty tree
but first it bow'd and syne it brak
sae my true love did lichtly me
a little time while it is new
but when 'tis auld it waxeth cauld
and fades awa' like morning dew
o wherefore should i busk my head
or wherefore should i kame my hair
for my true love has me forsook
and says he'll never loe me mair
the sheets sall ne'er be prest by me
saint anton's well sall be my drink
since my true love has forsaken me
marti'mas wind when wilt thou blaw
and shake the green leaves aff the tree
o gentle death when wilt thou come
for of my life i am wear e
nor blawing snaw's inclemencie
'tis not sic cauld that makes me cry
but my love's heart grown cauld to me
when we came in by glasgow town
we were a comely sight to see
my love was clad in the black velv t
and i mysell in cramasie
that love had been sae ill to win
i had lockt my heart in a case of gowd
and pinn'd it wi' a siller pin
and o if my young babe were born
and set upon the nurse's knee
and i mysell were dead and gane
and the green grass growing over me
night and day on me she cries
o that i were where helen lies
on fair kirconnell lea
and curst the hand that fired the shot
when in my arms burd helen dropt
and died to succour me
when my love dropt down and spak nae mair
i laid her down wi' meikle care
on fair kirconnell lea
none but my foe to be my guide
none but my foe to be my guide
on fair kirconnell lea
i hack d him in pieces sma'
i hack d him in pieces sma'
for her sake that died for me
i'll make a garland of thy hair
shall bind my heart for evermair
until the day i die
night and day on me she cries
out of my bed she bids me rise
says haste and come to me
if i were with thee i were blest
where thou lies low and takes thy rest
on fair kirconnell lea
a winding-sheet drawn ower my een
and i in helen's arms lying
on fair kirconnell lea
night and day on me she cries
and i am weary of the skies
since my love died for me
i heard twa corbies making a mane
the tane unto the t'other say
where sall we gang and dine to-day
i wot there lies a new-slain knight
and naebody kens that he lies there
but his hawk his hound and lady fair
his hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame
his lady's ta'en another mate
so we may mak our dinner sweet
and i'll pick out his bonny blue een
wi' ae lock o' his gowden hair
we'll theek our nest when it grows bare
but nane sall ken where he is gane
o'er his white banes when they are bare
the wind sall blaw for evermair
why do ye fall so fast
your date is not so past
but you may stay yet here awhile
to blush and gently smile
and go at last
an hour or half's delight
and so to bid good-night
'twas pity nature brought ye forth
merely to show your worth
and lose you quite
may read how soon things have
their end though ne'er so brave
and after they have shown their pride
like you awhile they glide
into the grave
you haste away so soon
as yet the early-rising sun
has not attain'd his noon
stay stay
until the hasting day
has run
but to the even-song
and having pray'd together we
will go with you along
we have as short a spring
as quick a growth to meet decay
as you or any thing
we die
as your hours do and dry
away
like to the summer's rain
or as the pearls of morning's dew
ne'er to be found again
to win the palm the oak or bays
and their incessant labours see
crown'd from some single herb or tree
whose short and narrow-verg d shade
does prudently their toils upbraid
while all the flowers and trees do close
to weave the garlands of repose
and innocence thy sister dear
mistaken long i sought you then
in busy companies of men
your sacred plants if here below
only among the plants will grow
society is all but rude
to this delicious solitude
so amorous as this lovely green
fond lovers cruel as their flame
cut in these trees their mistress' name
little alas they know or heed
how far these beauties hers exceed
fair trees where'er your barks i wound
no name shall but your own be found
love hither makes his best retreat
the gods who mortal beauty chase
still in a tree did end their race
apollo hunted daphne so
only that she might laurel grow
and pan did after syrinx speed
not as a nymph but for a reed
ripe apples drop about my head
the luscious clusters of the vine
upon my mouth do crush their wine
the nectarine and curious peach
into my hands themselves do reach
stumbling on melons as i pass
ensnared with flowers i fall on grass
withdraws into its happiness
the mind that ocean where each kind
does straight its own resemblance find
yet it creates transcending these
far other worlds and other seas
annihilating all that's made
to a green thought in a green shade
or at some fruit-tree's mossy root
casting the body's vest aside
my soul into the boughs does glide
there like a bird it sits and sings
then whets and claps its silver wings
and till prepared for longer flight
waves in its plumes the various light
while man there walk'd without a mate
after a place so pure and sweet
what other help could yet be meet
but 'twas beyond a mortal's share
to wander solitary there
two paradises are in one
to live in paradise alone
of flowers and herbs this dial new
where from above the milder sun
does through a fragrant zodiac run
and as it works th' industrious bee
computes its time as well as we
how could such sweet and wholesome hours
be reckon'd but with herbs and flowers
of cerberus and blackest midnight born
in stygian cave forlorn
'mongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy
find out some uncouth cell
where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings
and the night-raven sings
there under ebon shades and low-browed rocks
as ragged as thy locks
in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell
in heaven yclept euphrosyne
and by men heart-easing mirth
whom lovely venus at a birth
with two sister graces more
to ivy-crown d bacchus bore
or whether as some sager sing
the frolic wind that breathes the spring
zephyr with aurora playing
as he met her once a-maying--
there on beds of violets blue
and fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew
fill'd her with thee a daughter fair
so buxom blithe and debonair
haste thee nymph and bring with thee
jest and youthful jollity
quips and cranks and wanton wiles
nods and becks and wreath d smiles
such as hang on hebe's cheek
and love to live in dimple sleek
sport that wrinkled care derides
and laughter holding both his sides --
come and trip it as you go
on the light fantastic toe
and in thy right hand lead with thee
the mountain-nymph sweet liberty
and if i give thee honour due
mirth admit me of thy crew
to live with her and live with thee
in unreprov d pleasures free
to hear the lark begin his flight
and singing startle the dull night
from his watch-tower in the skies
till the dappled dawn doth rise
then to come in spite of sorrow
and at my window bid good-morrow
through the sweetbriar or the vine
or the twisted eglantine
while the cock with lively din
scatters the rear of darkness thin
and to the stack or the barn-door
stoutly struts his dames before
oft listening how the hounds and horn
cheerly rouse the slumbering morn
from the side of some hoar hill
through the high wood echoing shrill
sometime walking not unseen
by hedgerow elms on hillocks green
right against the eastern gate
where the great sun begins his state
robed in flames and amber light
the clouds in thousand liveries dight
while the ploughman near at hand
whistles o'er the furrow'd land
and the milkmaid singeth blithe
and the mower whets his scythe
and every shepherd tells his tale
under the hawthorn in the dale
straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures
whilst the landscape round it measures
russet lawns and fallows gray
where the nibbling flocks do stray
mountains on whose barren breast
the labouring clouds do often rest
meadows trim with daisies pied
shallow brooks and rivers wide
towers and battlements it sees
bosom'd high in tufted trees
where perhaps some beauty lies
the cynosure of neighbouring eyes
hard by a cottage chimney smokes
from betwixt two aged oaks
where corydon and thyrsis met
are at their savoury dinner set
of herbs and other country messes
which the neat-handed phyllis dresses
and then in haste her bower she leaves
with thestylis to bind the sheaves
or if the earlier season lead
to the tann'd haycock in the mead
sometimes with secure delight
the upland hamlets will invite
when the merry bells ring round
and the jocund rebecks sound
to many a youth and many a maid
dancing in the chequer'd shade
and young and old come forth to play
on a sun-shine holy-day
till the live-long day-light fail
then to the spicy nut-brown ale
with stories told of many a feat
how faery mab the junkets eat
she was pinch'd and pull'd she said
and he by friar's lantern led
tells how the drudging goblin sweat
to earn his cream-bowl duly set
when in one night ere glimpse of morn
his shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn
that ten day-labourers could not end
then lies him down the lubber fiend
and stretch'd out all the chimney's length
basks at the fire his hairy strength
and crop-full out of doors he flings
ere the first cock his matin rings
thus done the tales to bed they creep
by whispering winds soon lull'd asleep
tower'd cities please us then
and the busy hum of men
where throngs of knights and barons bold
in weeds of peace high triumphs hold
with store of ladies whose bright eyes
rain influence and judge the prize
of wit or arms while both contend
to win her grace whom all commend
there let hymen oft appear
in saffron robe with taper clear
and pomp and feast and revelry
with mask and antique pageantry
such sights as youthful poets dream
on summer eves by haunted stream
then to the well-trod stage anon
if jonson's learned sock be on
or sweetest shakspeare fancy's child
warble his native wood-notes wild
and ever against eating cares
lap me in soft lydian airs
married to immortal verse
such as the meeting soul may pierce
in notes with many a winding bout
of link d sweetness long drawn out
with wanton heed and giddy cunning
the melting voice through mazes running
untwisting all the chains that tie
the hidden soul of harmony
that orpheus' self may heave his head
from golden slumber on a bed
of heap'd elysian flowers and hear
such strains as would have won the ear
of pluto to have quite set free
his half-regain'd eurydice
these delights if thou canst give
mirth with thee i mean to live
the brood of folly without father bred
how little you bestead
or fill the fix d mind with all your toys
dwell in some idle brain
and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess
as thick and numberless
as the gay motes that people the sunbeams
or likest hovering dreams
the fickle pensioners of morpheus' train
hail divinest melancholy
whose saintly visage is too bright
to hit the sense of human sight
and therefore to our weaker view
o'erlaid with black staid wisdom's hue
black but such as in esteem
prince memnon's sister might beseem
or that starr'd ethiop queen that strove
to set her beauty's praise above
the sea-nymphs and their powers offended
yet thou art higher far descended
thee bright-hair'd vesta long of yore
to solitary saturn bore
his daughter she in saturn's reign
such mixture was not held a stain
oft in glimmering bowers and glades
he met her and in secret shades
of woody ida's inmost grove
whilst yet there was no fear of jove
come pensive nun devout and pure
sober steadfast and demure
all in a robe of darkest grain
flowing with majestic train
and sable stole of cypres lawn
over thy decent shoulders drawn
come but keep thy wonted state
with even step and musing gait
and looks commercing with the skies
thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes
there held in holy passion still
forget thyself to marble till
with a sad leaden downward cast
thou fix them on the earth as fast
and join with thee calm peace and quiet
spare fast that oft with gods doth diet
and hears the muses in a ring
aye round about jove's altar sing
and add to these retired leisure
that in trim gardens takes his pleasure --
but first and chiefest with thee bring
him that yon soars on golden wing
guiding the fiery-wheel d throne
the cherub contemplati n
and the mute silence hist along
'less philomel will deign a song
in her sweetest saddest plight
smoothing the rugged brow of night
while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
gently o'er the accustom'd oak
--sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly
most musical most melancholy
thee chauntress oft the woods among
i woo to hear thy even-song
and missing thee i walk unseen
on the dry smooth-shaven green
to behold the wandering moon
riding near her highest noon
like one that had been led astray
through the heaven's wide pathless way
and oft as if her head she bow'd
stooping through a fleecy cloud
oft on a plat of rising ground
i hear the far-off curfeu sound
over some wide-water'd shore
swinging slow with sullen roar
or if the air will not permit
some still remov d place will fit
where glowing embers through the room
teach light to counterfeit a gloom
far from all resort of mirth
save the cricket on the hearth
or the bellman's drowsy charm
to bless the doors from nightly harm
or let my lamp at midnight hour
be seen in some high lonely tower
where i may oft out-watch the bear
with thrice-great hermes or unsphere
the spirit of plato to unfold
what worlds or what vast regions hold
the immortal mind that hath forsook
her mansion in this fleshy nook
and of those demons that are found
in fire air flood or under ground
whose power hath a true consent
with planet or with element
sometime let gorgeous tragedy
in sceptr'd pall come sweeping by
presenting thebes or pelops' line
or the tale of troy divine
or what though rare of later age
ennobled hath the buskin'd stage
but o sad virgin that thy power
might raise musaeus from his bower
or bid the soul of orpheus sing
such notes as warbled to the string
drew iron tears down pluto's cheek
and made hell grant what love did seek
or call up him that left half-told
the story of cambuscan bold
of camball and of algarsife
and who had canac to wife
that own'd the virtuous ring and glass
and of the wondrous horse of brass
on which the tartar king did ride
and if aught else great bards beside
in sage and solemn tunes have sung
of tourneys and of trophies hung
of forests and enchantments drear
where more is meant than meets the ear
thus night oft see me in thy pale career
till civil-suited morn appear
not trick'd and frounced as she was wont
with the attic boy to hunt
but kercheft in a comely cloud
while rocking winds are piping loud
or usher'd with a shower still
when the gust hath blown his fill
ending on the rustling leaves
with minute drops from off the eaves
and when the sun begins to fling
his flaring beams me goddess bring
to arch d walks of twilight groves
and shadows brown that sylvan loves
of pine or monumental oak
where the rude axe with heav d stroke
was never heard the nymphs to daunt
or fright them from their hallow'd haunt
there in close covert by some brook
where no profaner eye may look
hide me from day's garish eye
while the bee with honey'd thigh
that at her flowery work doth sing
and the waters murmuring
with such consort as they keep
entice the dewy-feather'd sleep
and let some strange mysterious dream
wave at his wings in aery stream
of lively portraiture display'd
softly on my eyelids laid
and as i wake sweet music breathe
above about or underneath
sent by some spirit to mortals good
or the unseen genius of the wood
but let my due feet never fail
to walk the studious cloister's pale
and love the high-embow d roof
with antique pillars massy proof
and storied windows richly dight
casting a dim religious light
there let the pealing organ blow
to the full-voiced quire below
in service high and anthems clear
as may with sweetness through mine ear
dissolve me into ecstasies
and bring all heaven before mine eyes
and may at last my weary age
find out the peaceful hermitage
the hairy gown and mossy cell
where i may sit and rightly spell
of every star that heaven doth show
and every herb that sips the dew
till old experience do attain
to something like prophetic strain
and i with thee will choose to live
in the ocean's bosom unespied
from a small boat that row'd along
the listening woods received this song
that led us through the watery maze
where he the huge sea-monsters wracks
that lift the deep upon their backs
unto an isle so long unknown
and yet far kinder than our own
he lands us on a grassy stage
safe from the storms and prelate's rage
he gave us this eternal spring
which here enamels everything
and sends the fowls to us in care
on daily visits through the air
he hangs in shades the orange bright
like golden lamps in a green night
and does in the pomegranates close
jewels more rich than ormus shows
he makes the figs our mouths to meet
and throws the melons at our feet
but apples plants of such a price
no tree could ever bear them twice
with cedars chosen by his hand
from lebanon he stores the land
and makes the hollow seas that roar
proclaim the ambergris on shore
he cast of which we rather boast
the gospel's pearl upon our coast
and in these rocks for us did frame
a temple where to sound his name
o let our voice his praise exalt
till it arrive at heaven's vault
which then perhaps rebounding may
echo beyond the mexique bay
--thus sung they in the english boat
a holy and a cheerful note
and all the way to guide their chime
with falling oars they kept the time
sphere-born harmonious sisters voice and verse
wed your divine sounds and mixt power employ
dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce
and to our high-raised phantasy present
that undisturb d song of pure concent
ay sung before the sapphire-colour'd throne
to him that sits thereon
with saintly shout and solemn jubilee
where the bright seraphim in burning row
their loud uplifted angel-trumpets blow
and the cherubic host in thousand quires
touch their immortal harps of golden wires
with those just spirits that wear victorious palms
hymns devout and holy psalms
singing everlastingly
that we on earth with undiscording voice
may rightly answer that melodious noise
as once we did till disproportion'd sin
jarr'd against nature's chime and with harsh din
broke the fair music that all creatures made
to their great lord whose love their motion sway'd
in perfect diapason whilst they stood
in first obedience and their state of good
o may we soon again renew that song
and keep in tune with heaven till god ere long
to his celestial consort us unite
to live with him and sing in endless morn of light
by philip's warlike son--
aloft in awful state
the godlike hero sate
on his imperial throne
his valiant peers were placed around
their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
so should desert in arms be crown'd
the lovely thais by his side
sate like a blooming eastern bride
in flower of youth and beauty's pride --
happy happy happy pair
none but the brave
none but the brave
none but the brave deserves the fair
amid the tuneful quire
with flying fingers touch'd the lyre
the trembling notes ascend the sky
and heavenly joys inspire
the song began from jove
who left his blissful seats above--
such is the power of mighty love
a dragon's fiery form belied the god
sublime on radiant spires he rode
when he to fair olympia prest
and while he sought her snowy breast
then round her slender waist he curl'd
and stamp'd an image of himself a sovereign of the world
--the listening crowd admire the lofty sound
a present deity they shout around
a present deity the vaulted roofs rebound
with ravish'd ears
the monarch hears
assumes the god
affects to nod
and seems to shake the spheres
of bacchus ever fair and ever young
the jolly god in triumph comes
sound the trumpets beat the drums
flush'd with a purple grace
he shows his honest face
now give the hautboys breath he comes he comes
bacchus ever fair and young
drinking joys did first ordain
bacchus' blessings are a treasure
drinking is the soldier's pleasure
rich the treasure
sweet the pleasure
sweet is pleasure after pain
fought all his battles o'er again
and thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain
the master saw the madness rise
his glowing cheeks his ardent eyes
and while he heaven and earth defied
changed his hand and check'd his pride
he chose a mournful muse
soft pity to infuse
he sung darius great and good
by too severe a fate
fallen fallen fallen fallen
fallen from his high estate
and weltering in his blood
deserted at his utmost need
by those his former bounty fed
on the bare earth exposed he lies
with not a friend to close his eyes
--with downcast looks the joyless victor sate
revolving in his alter'd soul
the various turns of chance below
and now and then a sigh he stole
and tears began to flow
that love was in the next degree
'twas but a kindred-sound to move
for pity melts the mind to love
softly sweet in lydian measures
soon he soothed his soul to pleasures
war he sung is toil and trouble
honour but an empty bubble
never ending still beginning
fighting still and still destroying
if the world be worth thy winning
think o think it worth enjoying
lovely thais sits beside thee
take the good the gods provide thee
--the many rend the skies with loud applause
so love was crown'd but music won the cause
the prince unable to conceal his pain
gazed on the fair
who caused his care
and sigh'd and look'd sigh'd and look'd
sigh'd and look'd and sigh'd again
at length with love and wine at once opprest
the vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast
a louder yet and yet a louder strain
break his bands of sleep asunder
and rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder
hark hark the horrid sound
has raised up his head
as awaked from the dead
and amazed he stares around
revenge revenge timotheus cries
see the furies arise
see the snakes that they rear
how they hiss in their hair
and the sparkles that flash from their eyes
behold a ghastly band
each a torch in his hand
those are grecian ghosts that in battle were slain
and unburied remain
inglorious on the plain
give the vengeance due
to the valiant crew
behold how they toss their torches on high
how they point to the persian abodes
and glittering temples of their hostile gods
--the princes applaud with a furious joy
and the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy
thais led the way
to light him to his prey
and like another helen fired another troy
ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow
while organs yet were mute
timotheus to his breathing flute
and sounding lyre
could swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire
at last divine cecilia came
inventress of the vocal frame
the sweet enthusiast from her sacred store
enlarged the former narrow bounds
and added length to solemn sounds
with nature's mother-wit and arts unknown before
--let old timotheus yield the prize
or both divide the crown
he raised a mortal to the skies
she drew an angel down
eighteenth century than that of any other for it was an age not only of
spontaneous transition but of bold experiment it includes not only
such divergences of thought as distinguished the rape of the lock from
the parish register but such vast contemporaneous differences as lie
between pope and collins burns and cowper yet we may clearly trace
three leading moods or tendencies --the aspects of courtly or educated
life represented by pope and carried to exhaustion by his followers the
poetry of nature and of man viewed through a cultivated and at the
same time an impassioned frame of mind by collins and gray --lastly the
study of vivid and simple narrative including natural description
begun by gay and thomson pursued by burns and others in the north and
established in england by goldsmith percy crabbe and cowper great
varieties in style accompanied these diversities in aim poets could not
always distinguish the manner suitable for subjects so far apart and
the union of the language of courtly and of common life exhibited most
conspicuously by burns has given a tone to the poetry of that century
which is better explained by reference to its historical origin than by
naming it in the common criticism of our day artificial there is
again a nobleness of thought a courageous aim at high and in a strict
sense manly excellence in many of the writers --nor can that period be
justly termed tame and wanting in originality which produced poems such
as pope's satires gray's odes and elegy the ballads of gay and carey
the songs of burns and cowper in truth poetry at this as at all times
was a more or less unconscious mirror of the genius of the age and the
brave and admirable spirit of enquiry which made the eighteenth century
the turning-time in european civilisation is reflected faithfully in its
verse an intelligent reader will find the influence of newton as
markedly in the poems of pope as of elizabeth in the plays of
shakespeare on this great subject however these indications must here
be sufficient
waves her dew-bespangled wing
with vermeil cheek and whisper soft
she woos the tardy spring
till april starts and calls around
the sleeping fragrance from the ground
and lightly o'er the living scene
scatters his freshest tenderest green
frisking ply their feeble feet
forgetful of their wintry trance
the birds his presence greet
but chief the sky-lark warbles high
his trembling thrilling ecstasy
and lessening from the dazzled sight
melts into air and liquid light
saw the snowy whirlwind fly
mute was the music of the air
the herd stood drooping by
their raptures now that wildly flow
no yesterday nor morrow know
'tis man alone that joy descries
with forward and reverted eyes
soft reflection's hand can trace
and o'er the cheek of sorrow throw
a melancholy grace
while hope prolongs our happier hour
or deepest shades that dimly lour
and blacken round our weary way
gilds with a gleam of distant day
see a kindred grief pursue
behind the steps that misery treads
approaching comfort view
the hues of bliss more brightly glow
chastised by sabler tints of woe
and blended form with artful strife
the strength and harmony of life
on the thorny bed of pain
at length repair his vigour lost
and breathe and walk again
the meanest floweret of the vale
the simplest note that swells the gale
the common sun the air the skies
to him are opening paradise
a few paternal acres bound
content to breathe his native air
in his own ground
whose flocks supply him with attire
whose trees in summer yield him shade
in winter fire
hours days and years slide soft away
in health of body peace of mind
quiet by day
together mix'd sweet recreation
and innocence which most does please
with meditation
thus unlamented let me die
steal from the world and not a stone
tell where i lie
which i must ne'er enjoy
what are the blessings of the sight
o tell your poor blind boy
you say the sun shines bright
i feel him warm but how can he
or make it day or night
whene'er i sleep or play
and could i ever keep awake
with me 'twere always day
you mourn my hapless woe
but sure with patience i can bear
a loss i ne'er can know
my cheer of mind destroy
whilst thus i sing i am a king
although a poor blind boy
where china's gayest art had dyed
the azure flowers that blow
demurest of the tabby kind
the pensive selima reclined
gazed on the lake below
the fair round face the snowy beard
the velvet of her paws
her coat that with the tortoise vies
her ears of jet and emerald eyes--
she saw and purr'd applause
two angel forms were seen to glide
the genii of the stream
their scaly armour's tyrian hue
through richest purple to the view
betray'd a golden gleam
a whisker first and then a claw
with many an ardent wish
she stretch'd in vain to reach the prize--
what female heart can gold despise
what cat's averse to fish
again she stretch'd again she bent
nor knew the gulf between--
malignant fate sat by and smiled--
the slippery verge her feet beguiled
she tumbled headlong in
she mew'd to every watery god
some speedy aid to send --
no dolphin came no nereid stirr'd
nor cruel tom nor susan heard--
a favourite has no friend
know one false step is ne'er retrieved
and be with caution bold
not all that tempts your wandering eyes
and heedless hearts is lawful prize
nor all that glisters gold
fondling of a happy pair
every morn and every night
their solicitous delight
sleeping waking still at ease
pleasing without skill to please
little gossip blithe and hale
tattling many a broken tale
singing many a tuneless song
lavish of a heedless tongue
simple maiden void of art
babbling out the very heart
yet abandon'd to thy will
yet imagining no ill
yet too innocent to blush
like the linnet in the bush
to the mother-linnet's note
moduling her slender throat
chirping forth thy petty joys
wanton in the change of toys
like the linnet green in may
flitting to each bloomy spray
wearied then and glad of rest
like the linnet in the nest --
this thy present happy lot
this in time will be forgot
other pleasures other cares
ever-busy time prepares
and thou shalt in thy daughter see
this picture once resembled thee
arose from out the azure main
this was the charter of her land
and guardian angels sung the strain
rule brittania brittania rules the waves
britons never shall be slaves
must in their turn to tyrants fall
whilst thou shalt flourish great and free
the dread and envy of them all
more dreadful from each foreign stroke
as the loud blast that tears the skies
serves but to root thy native oak
all their attempts to bend thee down
will but arouse thy generous flame
and work their woe and thy renown
thy cities shall with commerce shine
all thine shall be the subject main
and every shore it circles thine
shall to thy happy coast repair
blest isle with matchless beauty crown'd
and manly hearts to guard the fair --
rule britannia brittania rules the waves
britons never shall be slaves
confusion on thy banners wait
tho' fann'd by conquest's crimson wing
they mock the air with idle state
helm nor hauberk's twisted mail
nor e'en thy virtues tyrant shall avail
to save thy secret soul from nightly fears
from cambria's curse from cambria's tears
--such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride
of the first edward scatter'd wild dismay
as down the steep of snowdon's shaggy side
he wound with toilsome march his long array --
stout glo'ster stood aghast in speechless trance
to arms cried mortimer and couch'd quivering lance
frowns o'er old conway's foaming flood
robed in the sable garb of woe
with haggard eyes the poet stood
loose his beard and hoary hair
stream'd like a meteor to the troubled air
and with a master's hand and prophet's fire
struck the deep sorrows of his lyre
hark how each giant oak and desert-cave
sighs to the torrent's awful voice beneath
o'er thee o king their hundred arms they wave
revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe
vocal no more since cambria's fatal day
to high-born hoel's harp or soft llewellyn's lay
that hush'd the stormy main
brave urien sleeps upon his craggy bed
mountains ye mourn in vain
modred whose magic song
made huge plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head
on dreary arvon's shore they lie
smear'd with gore and ghastly pale
far far aloof the affrighted ravens sail
the famish'd eagle screams and passes by
dear lost companions of my tuneful art
dear as the light that visits these sad eyes
dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart
ye died amidst your dying country's cries--
no more i weep they do not sleep
on yonder cliffs a griesly band
i see them sit they linger yet
avengers of their native land
with me in dreadful harmony they join
and weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line
the winding-sheet of edward's race
give ample room and verge enough
the characters of hell to trace
mark the year and mark the night
when severn shall re-echo with affright
the shrieks of death thro' berkley's roof that ring
shrieks of an agonising king
she-wolf of france with unrelenting fangs
that tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate
from thee be born who o'er thy country hangs
the scourge of heaven what terrors round him wait
amazement in his van with flight combined
and sorrow's faded form and solitude behind
low on his funeral couch he lies
no pitying heart no eye afford
a tear to grace his obsequies
is the sable warrior fled
thy son is gone he rests among the dead
the swarm that in thy noon-tide beam were born
--gone to salute the rising morn
fair laughs the morn and soft the zephyr blows
while proudly riding o'er the azure realm
in gallant trim the gilded vessel goes
youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm
regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway
that hush'd in grim repose expects his evening prey
the rich repast prepare
reft of a crown he yet may share the feast
close by the regal chair
fell thirst and famine scowl
a baleful smile upon their baffled guest
heard ye the din of battle bray
lance to lance and horse to horse
long years of havock urge their destined course
and thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way
ye towers of julius london's lasting shame
with many a foul and midnight murder fed
revere his consort's faith his father's fame
and spare the meek usurper's holy head
above below the rose of snow
twined with her blushing foe we spread
the bristled boar in infant gore
wallows beneath the thorny shade
now brothers bending o'er the accurs d loom
stamp we our vengeance deep and ratify his doom
weave we the woof the thread is spun
half of thy heart we consecrate
the web is wove the work is done
stay o stay nor thus forlorn
leave me unbless'd unpitied here to mourn
in yon bright track that fires the western skies
they melt they vanish from my eyes
but o what solemn scenes on snowdon's height
descending slow their glittering skirts unroll
visions of glory spare my aching sight
ye unborn ages crowd not on my soul
no more our long-lost arthur we bewail --
all hail ye genuine kings britannia's issue hail
sublime their starry fronts they rear
and gorgeous dames and statesmen old
in bearded majesty appear
in the midst a form divine
her eye proclaims her of the briton-line
her lion-port her awe-commanding face
attemper'd sweet to virgin-grace
what strings symphonious tremble in the air
what strains of vocal transport round her play
hear from the grave great taliessin hear
they breathe a soul to animate thy clay
bright rapture calls and soaring as she sings
waves in the eye of heaven her many-colour'd wings
fierce war and faithful love
and truth severe by fairy fiction drest
in buskin'd measures move
pale grief and pleasing pain
with horror tyrant of the throbbing breast
a voice as of the cherub-choir
gales from blooming eden bear
and distant warblings lessen on my ear
that lost in long futurity expire
fond impious man think'st thou yon sanguine cloud
raised by thy breath has quench'd the orb of day
to-morrow he repairs the golden flood
and warms the nations with redoubled ray
enough for me with joy i see
the different doom our fates assign
be thine despair and sceptred care
to triumph and to die are mine
he spoke and headlong from the mountain's height
deep in the roaring tide he plunged to endless night
by all their country's wishes blest
when spring with dewy fingers cold
returns to deck their hallow'd mould
she there shall dress a sweeter sod
than fancy's feet have ever trod
by forms unseen their dirge is sung
there honour comes a pilgrim gray
to bless the turf that wraps their clay
and freedom shall awhile repair
to dwell a weeping hermit there
nae joy nor pleasure can she see
for e'en and morn she cries alas
and aye the saut tear blink's her ee
drumossie moor--drumossie day--
a waefu' day it was to me
for there i lost my father dear
my father dear and brethren three
their graves are growing green to see
and by them lies the dearest lad
that ever blest a woman's ee
now wae to thee thou cruel lord
a bluidy man i trow thou be
for mony a heart thou hast made sair
that ne'er did wrong to thine or thee
lasses a' lilting before dawn o' day
but now they are moaning on ilka green loaning--
the flowers of the forest are a' wede away
lasses are lonely and dowie and wae
nae daffin' nae gabbin' but sighing and sabbing
ilk ane lifts her leglin and hies her away
bandsters are lyart and runkled and gray
at fair or at preaching nae wooing nae fleeching--
the flowers of the forest are a' wede away
'bout stacks wi' the lasses at bogle to play
but ilk ane sits drearie lamenting her dearie--
the flowers of the forest are weded away
the english for ance by guile wan the day
the flowers of the forest that fought aye the foremost
the prime of our land are cauld in the clay
women and bairns are heartless and wae
sighing and moaning on ilka green loaning--
the flowers of the forest are a' wede away
when first on them i met my lover
thy braes how dreary yarrow stream
when now thy waves his body cover
for ever now o yarrow stream
thou art to me a stream of sorrow
for never on thy banks shall i
behold my love the flower of yarrow
to bear me to his father's bowers
he promised me a little page
to squire me to his father's towers
he promised me a wedding-ring --
the wedding-day was fix'd to-morrow --
now he is wedded to his grave
alas his watery grave in yarrow
my passion i as freely told him
clasp'd in his arms i little thought
that i should never more behold him
scarce was he gone i saw his ghost
it vanish'd with a shriek of sorrow
thrice did the water-wraith ascend
and gave a doleful groan thro' yarrow
with all the longing of a mother
his little sister weeping walk'd
the green-wood path to meet her brother
they sought him east they sought him west
they sought him all the forest thorough
they only saw the cloud of night
they only heard the roar of yarrow
thou hast no son thou tender mother
no longer walk thou lovely maid
alas thou hast no more a brother
no longer seek him east or west
and search no more the forest thorough
for wandering in the night so dark
he fell a lifeless corpse in yarrow
no other youth shall be my marrow--
i'll seek thy body in the stream
and then with thee i'll sleep in yarrow
--the tear did never leave her cheek
no other youth became her marrow
she found his body in the stream
and now with him she sleeps in yarrow
where bonnie grows the lily
i heard a fair maid sighing say
my wish be wi' sweet willie
and willie's wondrous bonny
and willie hecht to marry me
gin e'er he married ony
from where my love repaireth
convey a kiss frae his dear mouth
and tell me how he fareth
and hear the mavis singing
and see the birds on ilka bush
and leaves around them hinging
and gentle throat sae narrow
there's sport eneuch for gentlemen
on leader haughs and yarrow
and yarrow haughs are bonny
there willie hecht to marry me
if e'er he married ony
and does not hear me weeping
draws many a tear frae true love's e'e
when other maids are sleeping
the night i'll mak' it narrow
for a' the live-lang winter night
i lie twined o' my marrow
pou'd you the rose or lily
or came you by yon meadow green
or saw you my sweet willie
she sought him braid and narrow
syne in the cleaving of a craig
she found him drown'd in yarrow
the brave that are no more
all sunk beneath the wave
fast by their native shore
whose courage well was tried
had made the vessel heel
and laid her on her side
and she was overset
down went the royal george
with all her crew complete
brave kempenfelt is gone
his last sea-fight is fought
his work of glory done
no tempest gave the shock
she sprang no fatal leak
she ran upon no rock
his fingers held the pen
when kempenfeld went down
with twice four hundred men
once dreaded by our foes
and mingle with our cup
the tear that england owes
and she may float again
full charged with england's thunder
and plough the distant main
his victories are o'er
and he and his eight hundred
shall plough the wave no more
the streamers waving in the wind
when black-eyed susan came aboard
o where shall i my true-love find
tell me ye jovial sailors tell me true
if my sweet william sails among the crew
rock'd with the billow to and fro
soon as her well-known voice he heard
he sigh'd and cast his eyes below
the cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands
and quick as lightning on the deck he stands
shuts close his pinions to his breast
if chance his mate's shrill call he hear
and drops at once into her nest --
the noblest captain in the british fleet
might envy william's lip those kisses sweet
my vows shall ever true remain
let me kiss off that falling tear
we only part to meet again
change as ye list ye winds my heart shall be
the faithful compass that still points to thee
who tempt with doubts thy constant mind
they'll tell thee sailors when away
in every port a mistress find
yes yes believe them when they tell thee so
for thou art present wheresoe'er i go
thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright
thy breath is afric's spicy gale
thy skin is ivory so white
thus every beauteous object that i view
wakes in my soul some charm of lovely sue
let not my pretty susan mourn
though cannons roar yet safe from harms
william shall to his dear return
love turns aside the balls that round me fly
lest precious tears should drop from susan's eye
the sails their swelling bosom spread
no longer must she stay aboard
they kiss'd she sigh'd he hung his head
her lessening boat unwilling rows to land
adieu she cries and waved her lily hand
there's none like pretty sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
there is no lady in the land
is half so sweet as sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
and through the streets does cry 'em
her mother she sells laces long
to such as please to buy 'em
but sure such folks could ne'er beget
so sweet a girl as sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
i love her so sincerely
my master comes like any turk
and bangs me most severely--
but let him bang his bellyful
i'll bear it all for sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
i dearly love but one day--
and that's the day that comes betwixt
a saturday and monday
for then i'm drest all in my best
to walk abroad with sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
and often am i blamed
because i leave him in the lurch
as soon as text is named
i leave the church in sermon-time
and slink away to sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
o then i shall have money
i'll hoard it up and box it all
i'll give it to my honey
i would it were ten thousand pound
i'd give it all to sally
she is the darling of my heart
and she lives in our alley
make game of me and sally
and but for her i'd better be
a slave and row a galley
but when my seven long years are out
o then i'll marry sally --
o then we'll wed and then we'll bed
but not in our alley
and fill it in a silver tassie
that i may drink before i go
a service to my bonnie lassie
the boat rocks at the pier of leith
fu' loud the wind blaws frae the ferry
the ship rides by the berwick-law
and i maun leave my bonnie mary
the glittering spears are rank d ready
the shouts o' war are heard afar
the battle closes thick and bloody
but it's not the roar o' sea or shore
wad make me langer wish to tarry
nor shouts o' war that's heard afar--
it's leaving thee my bonnie mary
right soon i'll mount my steed
and strong his arm and fast his seat
that bears frae me the meed
i'll wear thy colours in my cap
thy picture in my heart
and he that bends not to thine eye
shall rue it to his smart
then tell me how to woo thee love
o tell me how to woo thee
for thy dear sake nae care i'll take
tho' ne'er another trow me
i'll dight me in array
i'll tend thy chamber door all night
and squire thee all the day
if sweetest sounds can win thine ear
these sounds i'll strive to catch
thy voice i'll steal to woo thysell
that voice that nane can match
i never broke a vow
nae maiden lays her skaith to me
i never loved but you
for you alone i ride the ring
for you i wear the blue
for you alone i strive to sing
o tell me how to woo
then tell me how to woo thee love
o tell me how to woo thee
for thy dear sake nae care i'll take
tho' ne'er another trow me
apt emblem of a virtuous maid--
silent and chaste she steals along
far from the world's gay busy throng
with gentle yet prevailing force
intent upon her destined course
graceful and useful all she does
blessing and blest where'er she goes
pure-bosom'd as that watery glass
and heaven reflected in her face
tho' shut so close thy laughing eyes
thy rosy lips still wear a smile
and move and breathe delicious sighs
and mantle o'er her neck of snow
ah now she murmurs now she speaks
what most i wish--and fear to know
her fair hands folded on her breast
--and now how like a saint she sleeps
a seraph in the realms of rest
thy thoughts belong to heaven and thee
and may the secret of thy soul
remain within its sanctuary
an unrelenting foe to love
and when we meet a mutual heart
come in between and bid us part
and wish and wish the soul away
till youth and genial years are flown
and all the life of life is gone
to bind the loveless joyless vow
the heart from pleasure to delude
to join the gentle to the rude
and i absolve thy future care
all other blessings i resign
make but the dear amanda mine
conveys it in a borrow'd name
euphelia serves to grace my measure
but cloe is my real flame
upon euphelia's toilet lay--
when cloe noted her desire
that i should sing that i should play
but with my numbers mix my sighs
and whilst i sing euphelia's praise
i fix my soul on cloe's eyes
i sung and gazed i play'd and trembled
and venus to the loves around
remark'd how ill we all dissembled
and finds too late that men betray --
what charm can soothe her melancholy
what art can wash her guilt away
to hide her shame from every eye
to give repentance to her lover
and wring his bosom is--to die
how can ye blume sae fair
how can ye chant ye little birds
and i sae fu' o' care
that sings upon the bough
thou minds me o' the happy days
when my fause luve was true
that sings beside thy mate
for sae i sat and sae i sang
and wist na o' my fate
to see the woodbine twine
and ilka bird sang o' its love
and sae did i o' mine
frae aff its thorny tree
and my fause luver staw the rose
but left the thorn wi' me
and give to rapture all thy trembling strings
from helicon's harmonious springs
a thousand rills their mazy progress take
the laughing flowers that round them blow
drink life and fragrance as they flow
now the rich stream of music winds along
deep majestic smooth and strong
through verdant vales and ceres' golden reign
now rolling down the steep amain
headlong impetuous see it pour
the rocks and nodding groves re-bellow to the roar
parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs
enchanting shell the sullen cares
and frantic passions hear thy soft control
on thracia's hills the lord of war
has curb'd the fury of his car
and dropt his thirsty lance at thy command
perching on the sceptred hand
of jove thy magic lulls the feather'd king
with ruffled plumes and flagging wing
quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie
the terror of his beak and lightnings of his eye
temper'd to thy warbled lay
o'er idalia's velvet-green
the rosy-crown d loves are seen
on cytherea's day
with antic sport and blue-eyed pleasures
frisking light in frolic measures
now pursuing now retreating
now in circling troops they meet
to brisk notes in cadence beating
glance their many-twinkling feet
slow-melting strains their queen's approach declare
where'er she turns the graces homage pay
with arms sublime that float upon the air
in gliding state she wins her easy way
o'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move
the bloom of young desire and purple light of love
labour and penury the racks of pain
disease and sorrow's weeping train
and death sad refuge from the storms of fate
the fond complaint my song disprove
and justify the laws of jove
say has he given in vain the heavenly muse
night and all her sickly dews
her spectres wan and birds of boding cry
he gives to range the dreary sky
till down the eastern cliffs afar
hyperion's march they spy and glittering shafts of war
where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam
the muse has broke the twilight gloom
to cheer the shivering native's dull abode
and oft beneath the odorous shade
of chili's boundless forests laid
she deigns to hear the savage youth repeat
in loose numbers wildly sweet
their feather-cinctured chiefs and dusky loves
her track where'er the goddess roves
glory pursue and generous shame
th' unconquerable mind and freedom's holy flame
isles that crown th' aegean deep
fields that cool ilissus laves
or where maeander's amber waves
in lingering lab'rinths creep
how do your tuneful echoes languish
mute but to the voice of anguish
where each old poetic mountain
inspiration breathed around
every shade and hallow'd fountain
murmur'd deep a solemn sound
till the sad nine in greece's evil hour
left their parnassus for the latian plains
alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant power
and coward vice that revels in her chains
when latium had her lofty spirit lost
they sought o albion next thy sea-encircled coast
in thy green lap was nature's darling laid
what time where lucid avon stray'd
to him the mighty mother did unveil
her awful face the dauntless child
stretch'd forth his little arms and smiled
this pencil take she said whose colours clear
richly paint the vernal year
thine too these golden keys immortal boy
this can unlock the gates of joy
of horror that and thrilling fears
or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears
upon the seraph-wings of ecstasy
the secrets of the abyss to spy
he pass'd the flaming bounds of place and time
the living throne the sapphire-blaze
where angels tremble while they gaze
he saw but blasted with excess of light
closed his eyes in endless night
behold where dryden's less presumptuous car
wide o'er the fields of glory bear
two coursers of ethereal race
with necks in thunder clothed and long-resounding pace
bright-eyed fancy hovering o'er
scatters from her pictured urn
thoughts that breathe and words that burn
but ah 'tis heard no more--
o lyre divine what daring spirit
wakes thee now tho' he inherit
nor the pride nor ample pinion
that the theban eagle bear
sailing with supreme dominion
thro' the azure deep of air
yet oft before his infant eyes would run
such forms as glitter in the muse's ray
with orient hues unborrow'd of the sun
yet shall he mount and keep his distant way
beyond the limits of a vulgar fate
beneath the good how far--but far above the great
while yet in early greece she sung
the passions oft to hear her shell
throng'd around her magic cell
exulting trembling raging fainting
possest beyond the muse's painting
by turns they felt the glowing mind
disturb'd delighted raised refined
'till once 'tis said when all were fired
fill'd with fury rapt inspired
from the supporting myrtles round
they snatch'd her instruments of sound
and as they oft had heard apart
sweet lessons of her forceful art
each for madness ruled the hour
would prove his own expressive power
amid the chords bewilder'd laid
and back recoil'd he knew not why
e'en at the sound himself had made
in lightnings own'd his secret stings
in one rude clash he struck the lyre
and swept with hurried hand the strings
low sullen sounds his grief beguiled
a solemn strange and mingled air
'twas sad by fits by starts 'twas wild
what was thy delighted measure
still it whisper'd promised pleasure
and bade the lovely scenes at distance hail
still would her touch the strain prolong
and from the rocks the woods the vale
she call'd on echo still through all the song
and where her sweetest theme she chose
a soft responsive voice was heard at every close
and hope enchanted smiled and waved her golden hair --
and longer had she sung --but with a frown revenge impatient rose
he threw his blood-stain'd sword in thunder down
and with a withering look
the war-denouncing trumpet took
and blew a blast so loud and dread
were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe
and ever and anon he beat
the doubling drum with furious heat
and though sometimes each each dreary pause between
dejected pity at his side
her soul-subduing voice applied
yet still he kept his wild unalter'd mien
while each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head
sad proof of thy distressful state
of differing themes the veering song was mix'd
and now it courted love now raving call'd on hate
pale melancholy sat retired
and from her wild sequester'd seat
in notes by distance made more sweet
pour'd through the mellow horn her pensive soul
and dashing soft from rocks around
bubbling runnels join'd the sound
through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole
or o'er some haunted stream with fond delay
round an holy calm diffusing
love of peace and lonely musing
in hollow murmurs died away
when cheerfulness a nymph of healthiest hue
her bow across her shoulder flung
her buskins gemm'd with morning dew
blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung
the hunter's call to faun and dryad known
the oak-crown'd sisters and their chaste-eyed queen
satyrs and sylvan boys were seen
peeping from forth their alleys green
brown exercise rejoiced to hear
and sport leap'd up and seized his beechen spear
he with viny crown advancing
first to the lively pipe his hand addrest
but soon he saw the brisk awakening viol
whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best
they would have thought who heard the strain
they saw in tempe's vale her native maids
amidst the festal-sounding shades
to some unwearied minstrel dancing
while as his flying fingers kiss'd the stings
love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round
loose were her tresses seen her zone unbound
and he amidst his frolic play
as if he would the charming air repay
shook thousand odours from his dewy wings
friend of pleasure wisdom's aid
why goddess why to us denied
lay'st thou thy ancient lyre aside
as in that loved athenian bower
you learn'd an all-commanding power
thy mimic soul o nymph endear'd
can well recall what then it heard
where is thy native simple heart
devote to virtue fancy art
arise as in that elder time
warm energetic chaste sublime
thy wonders in that god-like age
fill thy recording sister's page --
'tis said and i believe the tale
thy humblest reed could more prevail
had more of strength diviner rage
than all which charms this laggard age
e'en all at once together found
cecilia's mingled world of sound --
o bid our vain endeavours cease
revive the just designs of greece
return in all thy simple state
confirm the tales her sons relate
fair venus' train appear
disclose the long-expecting flowers
and wake the purple year
the attic warbler pours her throat
responsive to the cuckoo's note
the untaught harmony of spring
while whispering pleasure as they fly
cool zephyrs through the clear blue sky
their gather'd fragrance fling
a broader browner shade
where'er the rude and moss-grown beech
o'er-canopies the glade
beside some water's rushy brink
with me the muse shall sit and think
at ease reclined in rustic state
how vain the ardour of the crowd
how low how little are the proud
how indigent the great
the panting herds repose
yet hark how thro' the peopled air
the busy murmur glows
the insect youth are on the wing
eager to taste the honied spring
and float amid the liquid noon
some lightly o'er the current skim
some show their gaily-gilded trim
quick-glancing to the sun
such is the race of man
and they that creep and they that fly
shall end where they began
alike the busy and the gay
but flutter thro' life's little day
in fortune's varying colours drest
brush'd by the hand of rough mischance
or chill'd by age their airy dance
they leave in dust to rest
the sportive kind reply
poor moralist and what art thou
a solitary fly
thy joys no glittering female meets
no hive hast thou of hoarded sweets
no painted plumage to display
on hasty wings thy youth is flown
thy sun is set thy spring is gone--
we frolic while 'tis may
and the whispering sound of the cool colonnade
the winds play no longer and sing in the leaves
nor ouse on his bosom their image receives
of my favourite field and the bank where they grew
and now in the grass behold they are laid
and the tree is my seat that once lent me a shade
where the hazels afford him a screen from the heat
and the scene where his melody charm'd me before
resounds with his sweet-flowing ditty no more
and i must ere long lie lowly as they
with a turf on my breast and a stone at my head
ere another such grove shall arise in its stead
to muse on the perishing pleasures of man
short-lived as we are our enjoyments i see
have a still shorter date and die sooner than we
o what a panic's in thy breastie
thou need na start awa sae hasty
wi' bickering brattle
i wad be laith to rin and chase thee
wi' murd'ring pattle
has broken nature's social union
an' justifies that ill opinion
which makes thee startle
at me thy poor earth-born companion
an' fellow-mortal
what then poor beastie thou maun live
a daimen icker in a thrave
's a sma' request
i'll get a blessin wi' the lave
an' never miss't
it's silly wa's the win's are strewin
an' naething now to big a new ane
o' foggage green
and bleak december's winds ensuin'
baith snell and keen
and weary winter comin' fast
and cozie here beneath the blast
thou thought to dwell
till crash the cruel coulter past
out thro' thy cell
has cost thee mony a weary nibble
now thou's turn'd out for a' thy trouble
but house or hald
to thole the winter's sleety dribble
an' cranreuch cauld
in proving foresight may be vain
the best laid schemes o' mice and men
gang aft a-gley
and lea'e us nought but grief and pain
for promised joy
the present only toucheth thee
but och i backward cast my e'e
on prospects drear
an' forward tho' i canna see
i guess and fear
a bee-hive's hum shall sooth my ear
a willowy brook that turns a mill
with many a fall shall linger near
shall twitter from her clay-built nest
oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch
and share my meal a welcome guest
each fragrant flower that drinks the dew
and lucy at her wheel shall sing
in russet-gown and apron blue
where first our marriage-vows were given
with merry peals shall swell the breeze
and point with taper spire to heaven
may hope chaste eve to soothe thy modest ear
like thy own solemn springs
thy springs and dying gales
sits in yon western tent whose cloudy skirts
with brede ethereal wove
o'erhang his wavy bed
with short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing
or where the beetle winds
his small but sullen horn
against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum --
now teach me maid composed
to breathe some soften'd strain
may not unseemly with its stillness suit
as musing slow i hail
thy genial loved return
his paly circlet at his warning lamp
the fragrant hours and elves
who slept in buds the day
and sheds the freshening dew and lovelier still
the pensive pleasures sweet
prepare thy shadowy car
or find some ruin midst its dreary dells
whose walls more awful nod
by thy religious gleams
prevent my willing feet be mine the hut
that from the mountain's side
views wilds and swelling floods
and hears their simple bell and marks o'er all
thy dewy fingers draw
the gradual dusky veil
and bathe thy breathing tresses meekest eve
while summer loves to sport
beneath thy lingering light
or winter yelling through the troublous air
affrights thy shrinking train
and rudely rends thy robes
shall fancy friendship science smiling peace
thy gentlest influence own
and love thy favourite name
the lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea
the ploughman homeward plods his weary way
and leaves the world to darkness and to me
and all the air a solemn stillness holds
save where the beetle wheels his droning flight
and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds
the moping owl does to the moon complain
of such as wandering near her secret bower
molest her ancient solitary reign
where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap
each in his narrow cell for ever laid
the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep
the swallow twittering from the straw-built shed
the cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn
no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed
or busy housewife ply her evening care
no children run to lisp their sire's return
or climb his knees the envied kiss to share
their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke
how jocund did they drive their team afield
how bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke
their homely joys and destiny obscure
nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
the short and simple annals of the poor
and all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave
await alike th' inevitable hour --
the paths of glory lead but to the grave
if memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise
where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
the pealing anthem swells the note of praise
back to its mansion call the fleeting breath
can honour's voice provoke the silent dust
or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death
some heart once pregnant with celestial fire
hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd
or waked to ecstasy the living lyre
rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll
chill penury repress'd their noble rage
and froze the genial current of the soul
the dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness on the desert air
the little tyrant of his fields withstood
some mute inglorious milton here may rest
some cromwell guiltless of his country's blood
the threats of pain and ruin to despise
to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land
and read their history in a nation's eyes
their growing virtues but their crimes confined
forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne
and shut the gates of mercy on mankind
to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame
or heap the shrine of luxury and pride
with incense kindled at the muse's flame
their sober wishes never learn'd to stray
along the cool sequester'd vale of life
they kept the noiseless tenour of their way
some frail memorial still erected nigh
with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd
implores the passing tribute of a sigh
the place of fame and elegy supply
and many a holy text around she strews
that teach the rustic moralist to die
this pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd
left the warm precincts of the cheerful day
nor cast one longing lingering look behind
some pious drops the closing eye requires
e'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries
e'en in our ashes live their wonted fires
dost in those lines their artless tale relate
if chance by lonely contemplation led
some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate --
oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
brushing with hasty steps the dews away
to meet the sun upon the upland lawn
that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high
his listless length at noon-tide would he stretch
and pore upon the brook that babbles by
muttering his wayward fancies he would rove
now drooping woeful-wan like one forlorn
or crazed with care or cross'd in hopeless love
along the heath and near his favourite tree
another came nor yet beside the rill
nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he
slow through the church-way path we saw him borne --
approach and read for thou canst read the lay
graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn
a youth to fortune and to fame unknown
fair science frown'd not on his humble birth
and melancholy mark'd him for her own
heaven did a recompense as largely send
he gave to misery all he had a tear
he gain'd from heaven 'twas all he wish'd a friend
or draw his frailties from their dread abode
there they alike in trembling hope repose
the bosom of his father and his god
it is the wish'd the trysted hour
those smiles and glances let me see
that make the miser's treasure poor
how blythely wad i bide the stoure
a weary slave frae sun to sun
could i the rich reward secure
the lovely mary morison
the dance gaed thro' the lighted ha'
to thee my fancy took its wing --
i sat but neither heard nor saw
tho' this was fair and that was braw
and yon the toast of a' the town
i sigh'd and said amang them a'
ye are na mary morison
wha for thy sake wad gladly dee
or canst thou break that heart of his
whase only faut is loving thee
if love for love thou wilt na gie
at least be pity to me shown
a thought ungentle canna be
the thought o' mary morison
as she gaed o'er the border
she's gane like alexander
to spread her conquests farther
and love but her for ever
for nature made her what she is
and ne'er made sic anither
thy subjects we before thee
thou art divine fair lesley
the hearts o' men adore thee
or aught that wad belang thee
he'd look into thy bonnie face
and say i canna wrang thee
misfortune sha' na steer thee
thou'rt like themselves sae lovely
that ill they'll ne'er let near thee
return to caledonie
that we may brag we hae a lass
there's nane again sae bonnie
that's newly sprung in june
o my luve's like the melodie
that's sweetly play'd in tune
so deep in luve am i
and i will luve thee still my dear
till a' the seas gang dry
and the rocks melt wi' the sun
i will luve thee still my dear
while the sands o' life shall run
and fare thee weel a while
and i will come again my luve
tho' it were ten thousand mile
the castle o' montgomery
green be your woods and fair your flowers
your waters never drumlie
there simmer first unfauld her robes
and there the langest tarry
for there i took the last fareweel
o' my sweet highland mary
how rich the hawthorn's blossom
as underneath their fragrant shade
i clasp'd her to my bosom
the golden hours on angel wings
flew o'er me and my dearie
for dear to me as light and life
was my sweet highland mary
our parting was fu' tender
and pledging aft to meet again
we tore oursels asunder
but o fell death's untimely frost
that nipt my flower sae early
now green's the sod and cauld's the clay
that wraps my highland mary
i aft hae kiss'd sae fondly
and closed for aye the sparkling glance
that dwelt on me sae kindly
and mouldering now in silent dust
that heart that lo'ed me dearly
but still within my bosom's core
shall live my highland mary
and a' the warld to rest are gane
the waes o' my heart fa' in showers frae my e'e
while my gudeman lies sound by me
but saving a croun he had naething else beside
to make the croun a pund young jamie gaed to sea
and the croun and the pund were baith for me
when my father brak his arm and the cow was stown awa
my mother she fell sick and my jamie at the sea--
and auld robin gray came a-courtin' me
i toil'd day and night but their bread i couldna win
auld rob maintain'd them baith and wi' tears in his e'e
said jennie for their sakes o marry me
but the wind it blew high and the ship it was a wrack
his ship it was a wrack--why didna jamie dee
or why do i live to cry wae's me
but she look'd in my face till my heart was like to break
they gi'ed him my hand but my heart was at the sea
sae auld robin gray he was gudeman to me
when mournfu' as i sat on the stane at the door
i saw my jamie's wraith for i couldna think it he--
till he said i'm come hame to marry thee
we took but ae kiss and i bad him gang away
i wish that i were dead but i'm no like to dee
and why was i born to say wae's me
i daurna think on jamie for that wad be a sin
but i'll do my best a gude wife aye to be
for auld robin gray he is kind unto me
ha ha the wooing o't

ha ha the wooing o't
maggie coost her head fu' high

meg grew sick--as he grew heal
something in her bosom wrings
for relief a sigh she brings
and o her een they spak sic things
maggie's was a piteous case
duncan could na be her death
swelling pity smoor'd his wrath
now they're crouse and canty baith
ha ha the wooing o't
and are ye sure he's weel
is this a time to think o' wark
ye jades lay by your wheel
is this the time to spin a thread
when colin's at the door
reach down my cloak i'll to the quay
and see him come ashore
for there's nae luck about the house
there's nae luck at a'
there's little pleasure in the house
when our gudeman's awa'
my bishop's satin gown
for i maun tell the baillie's wife
that colin's in the town
my turkey slippers maun gae on
my stockins pearly blue
it's a' to pleasure our gudeman
for he's baith leal and true
put on the muckle pot
gie little kate her button gown
and jock his sunday coat
and mak their shoon as black as slaes
their hose as white as snaw
it's a' to please my ain gudeman
for he's been long awa
been fed this month and mair
mak haste and thraw their necks about
that colin weel may fare
and spread the table neat and clean
gar ilka thing look braw
for wha can tell how colin fared
when he was far awa
his breath like caller air
his very foot has music in't
as he comes up the stair--
and will i see his face again
and will i hear him speak
i'm downright dizzy wi' the thought
in troth i'm like to greet
i hae nae mair to crave
and gin i live to keep him sae
i'm blest aboon the lave
and will i see his face again
and will i hear him speak
i'm downright dizzy wi' the thought
in troth i'm like to greet
there's nae luck at a'
there's little pleasure in the house
when our gudeman's awa
i dearly like the west
for there the bonnie lassie lives
the lassie i lo'e best
there wild woods grow and rivers row
and mony a hill between
but day and night my fancy's flight
is ever wi' my jean
i see her sweet and fair
i hear her in the tunefu' birds
i hear her charm the air
there's not a bonnie flower that springs
by fountain shaw or green
there's not a bonnie bird that sings
but minds me o' my jean
amang the leafy trees
wi' balmy gale frae hill and dale
bring hame the laden bees
and bring the lassie back to me
that's aye sae neat and clean
ae smile o' her wad banish care
sae charming is my jean
hae pass'd atween us twa
how fond to meet how wae to part
that night she gaed awa
the powers aboon can only ken
to whom the heart is seen
that nane can be sae dear to me
as my sweet lovely jean
when we were first acquent
your locks were like the raven
your bonnie brow was brent
but now your brow is bald john
your locks are like the snow
but blessings on your frosty pow
john anderson my jo
we clamb the hill thegither
and mony a canty day john
we've had wi' ane anither
now we maun totter down john
but hand in hand we'll go
and sleep thegither at the foot
john anderson my jo
like snaw when its thaw jean
i'm wearing awa'
to the land o' the leal
there's nae sorrow there jean
there's neither cauld nor care jean
the day is aye fair
in the land o' the leal
your task's ended noo jean
and i'll welcome you
to the land o' the leal
our bonnie bairn's there jean
she was baith guid and fair jean
o we grudged her right sair
to the land o' the leal
my soul langs to be free jean
and angels wait on me
to the land o' the leal
now fare ye weel my ain jean
this warld's care is vain jean
we'll meet and aye be fain
in the land o' the leal
that crown the wat'ry glade
where grateful science still adores
her henry's holy shade
and ye that from the stately brow
of windsor's heights th' expanse below
of grove of lawn of mead survey
whose turf whose shade whose flowers among
wanders the hoary thames along
his silver-winding way
ah fields beloved in vain
where once my careless childhood stray'd
a stranger yet to pain
i feel the gales that from ye blow
a momentary bliss bestow
as waving fresh their gladsome wing
my weary soul they seem to soothe
and redolent of joy and youth
to breathe a second spring
full many a sprightly race
disporting on thy margent green
the paths of pleasure trace
who foremost now delight to cleave
with pliant arm thy glassy wave
the captive linnet which enthral
what idle progeny succeed
to chase the rolling circle's speed
or urge the flying ball
their murmuring labours ply
'gainst graver hours that bring constraint
to sweeten liberty
some bold adventurers disdain
the limits of their little reign
and unknown regions dare descry
still as they run they look behind
they hear a voice in every wind
and snatch a fearful joy
less pleasing when possest
the tear forgot as soon as shed
the sunshine of the breast
theirs buxom health of rosy hue
wild wit invention ever new
and lively cheer of vigour born
the thoughtless day the easy night
the spirits pure the slumbers light
that fly th' approach of morn
the little victims play
no sense have they of ills to come
nor care beyond to-day
yet see how all around 'em wait
the ministers of human fate
and black misfortune's baleful train
ah shew them where in ambush stand
to seize their prey the murderous band
ah tell them they are men
the vultures of the mind
disdainful anger pallid fear
and shame that skulks behind
or pining love shall waste their youth
or jealousy with rankling tooth
that inly gnaws the secret heart
and envy wan and faded care
grim-visaged comfortless despair
and sorrow's piercing dart
then whirl the wretch from high
to bitter scorn a sacrifice
and grinning infamy
the stings of falsehood those shall try
and hard unkindness' alter'd eye
that mocks the tear it forced to flow
and keen remorse with blood defiled
and moody madness laughing wild
amid severest woe
a griesly troop are seen
the painful family of death
more hideous than their queen
this racks the joints this fires the veins
that every labouring sinew strains
those in the deeper vitals rage
lo poverty to fill the band
that numbs the soul with icy hand
and slow-consuming age
condemn'd alike to groan
the tender for another's pain
th' unfeeling for his own
yet ah why should they know their fate
since sorrow never comes too late
and happiness too swiftly flies
thought would destroy their paradise
no more --where ignorance is bliss
'tis folly to be wise
thou tamer of the human breast
whose iron scourge and torturing hour
the bad affright afflict the best
bound in thy adamantine chain
the proud are taught to taste of pain
and purple tyrants vainly groan
with pangs unfelt before unpitied and alone
virtue his darling child design'd
to thee he gave the heavenly birth
and bade to form her infant mind
stern rugged nurse thy rigid lore
with patience many a year she bore
what sorrow was thou bad'st her know
and from her own she learn'd to melt at others' woe
self-pleasing folly's idle brood
wild laughter noise and thoughtless joy
and leave us leisure to be good
light they disperse and with them go
the summer friend the flattering foe
by vain prosperity received
to her they vow their truth and are again believed
with leaden eye that loves the ground
still on thy solemn steps attend
warm charity the general friend
with justice to herself severe
and pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear
dread goddess lay thy chastening hand
not in thy gorgon terrors clad
not circled with the vengeful band
as by the impious thou art seen
with thundering voice and threatening mien
with screaming horror's funeral cry
despair and fell disease and ghastly poverty
thy milder influence impart
thy philosophic train be there
to soften not to wound my heart
the generous spark extinct revive
teach me to love and to forgive
exact my own defects to scan
what others are to feel and know myself a man
my right there is none to dispute
from the centre all round to the sea
i am lord of the fowl and the brute
o solitude where are the charms
that sages have seen in thy face
better dwell in the midst of alarms
than reign in this horrible place
i must finish my journey alone
never hear the sweet music of speech
i start at the sound of my own
the beasts that roam over the plain
my form with indifference see
they are so unacquainted with man
their tameness is shocking to me
divinely bestow'd upon man
o had i the wings of a dove
how soon would i taste you again
my sorrows i then might assuage
in the ways of religion and truth
might learn from the wisdom of age
and be cheer'd by the sallies of youth
convey to this desolate shore
some cordial endearing report
of a land i shall visit no more
my friends do they now and then send
a wish or a thought after me
o tell me i yet have a friend
though a friend i am never to see
compared with the speed of its flight
the tempest itself lags behind
and the swift-wing d arrows of light
when i think of my own native land
in a moment i seem to be there
but alas recollection at hand
soon hurries me back to despair
the beast is laid down in his lair
even here is a season of rest
and i to my cabin repair
there's mercy in every place
and mercy encouraging thought
gives even affliction a grace
and reconciles man to his lot
such aid from heaven as some have feign'd they drew
an eloquence scarce given to mortals new
and undebased by praise of meaner things
i may record thy worth with honour due
in verse as musical as thou art true
and that immortalizes whom it sings --
by seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light
on which the eyes of god not rarely look
there all thy deeds my faithful mary shine
and since thou own'st that praise i spare thee mine
since first our sky was overcast
ah would that this might be the last
my mary
i see thee daily weaker grow--
'twas my distress that brought thee low
my mary
for my sake restless heretofore
now rust disused and shine no more
my mary
the same kind office for me still
thy sight now seconds not thy will
my mary
and all thy threads with magic art
have wound themselves about this heart
my mary
like language utter'd in a dream
yet me they charm whate'er the theme
my mary
are still more lovely in my sight
than golden beams of orient light
my mary
what sight worth seeing could i see
the sun would rise in vain for me
my mary
thy hands their little force resign
yet gently press'd press gently mine
my mary
that now at every step thou mov'st
upheld by two yet still thou lov'st
my mary
in wintry age to feel no chill
with me is to be lovely still
my mary
how oft the sadness that i show
transforms thy smiles to looks of woe
my mary
with much resemblance of the past
thy worn-out heart will break at last--
my mary
dost thou thy little spot survey
from tree to tree with doubtful cheer
pursue the progress of the year
what winds arise what rains descend
when thou before that year shalt end
to clear the leaf and pick the snail
then wantonly to death decree
an insect usefuller than thee
thou and the worm are brother-kind
as low as earthy and as blind
the downy peach make court to thee
or that thy sense shall ever meet
the bean-flower's deep-embosom'd sweet
exhaling with an evening blast
thy evenings then will all be past
for vanity's in little seen
all must be left when death appears
in spite of wishes groans and tears
nor one of all thy plants that grow
but rosemary will with thee go
may my lot no less fortunate be
than a snug elbow-chair can afford for reclining
and a cot that o'erlooks the wide sea
with an ambling pad-pony to pace o'er the lawn
while i carol away idle sorrow
and blithe as the lark that each day hails the dawn
look forward with hope for to-morrow
as the sunshine or rain may prevail
and a small spot of ground for the use of the spade too
with a barn for the use of the flail
a cow for my dairy a dog for my game
and a purse when a friend wants to borrow
i'll envy no nabob his riches or fame
nor what honours await him to-morrow
secured by a neighbouring hill
and at night may repose steal upon me more sweetly
by the sound of a murmuring rill
and while peace and plenty i find at my board
with a heart free from sickness and sorrow
with my friends may i share what to-day may afford
and let them spread the table to-morrow
which i've worn for three-score years and ten
on the brink of the grave i'll not seek to keep hovering
nor my thread wish to spin o'er again
but my face in the glass i'll serenely survey
and with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow
as this old worn-out stuff which is threadbare to-day
may become everlasting to-morrow
but know that thou and i must part
and when or how or where we met
i own to me's a secret yet
through pleasant and through cloudy weather
'tis hard to part when friends are dear--
perhaps 'twill cost a sigh a tear
--then steal away give little warning
choose thine own time
say not good night --but in some brighter clime
bid me good morning
the pieces which without conscious departure from the standard of
excellence render this book by far the longest were with very few
exceptions composed during the first thirty years the nineteenth
century exhaustive reasons can hardly be given for the strangely sudden
appearance of individual genius but none in the editor's judgment can
be less adequate than that which assigns the splendid national
achievements of our recent poetry to an impulse from the frantic
follies and criminal wars that at the time disgraced the least
essentially civilised of our foreign neighbours the first french
revolution was rather in his opinion one result and in itself by no
means the most important of that far wider and greater spirit which
through enquiry and doubt through pain and triumph sweeps mankind
round the circles of its gradual development and it is to this that we
must trace the literature of modern europe but without more detailed
discussion on the motive causes of scott wordsworth campbell keats
and shelley we may observe that these poets with others carried to
further perfection the later tendencies of the century preceding in
simplicity of narrative reverence for human passion and character in
every sphere and impassioned love of nature --that whilst maintaining
on the whole the advances in art made since the restoration they
renewed the half-forgotten melody and depth of tone which marked the
best elizabethan writers --that lastly to what was thus inherited they
added a richness in language and a variety in metre a force and fire in
narrative a tenderness and bloom in feeling an insight into the finer
passages of the soul and the inner meanings of the landscape a larger
and wiser humanity --hitherto hardly attained and perhaps unattainable
even by predecessors of not inferior individual genius in a word the
nation which after the greeks in their glory has been the most gifted
of all nations for poetry expressed in these men the highest strength
and prodigality of its nature they interpreted the age to itself--hence
the many phases of thought and style they present --to sympathise with
each fervently and impartially without fear and without fancifulness
is no doubtful step in the higher education of the soul for as with
the affections and the conscience purity in taste is absolutely
proportionate to strength --and when once the mind has raised itself to
grasp and to delight in excellence those who love most will be found to
love most wisely
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
that deep-brow'd homer ruled as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
silent upon a peak in darien
ye have left your souls on earth
have ye souls in heaven too
doubled-lived in regions new
--yes and those of heaven commune
with the spheres of sun and moon
with the noise of fountains wonderous
and the parle of voices thunderous
with the whisper of heaven's trees
and one another in soft ease
seated on elysian lawns
browsed by none but dian's fawns
underneath large blue-bells tented
where the daisies are rose-scented
and the rose herself has got
perfume which on earth is not
where the nightingale doth sing
not a senseless tranc d thing
but divine melodious truth
philosophic numbers smooth
tales and golden histories
of heaven and its mysteries
on the earth ye live again
and the souls ye left behind you
teach us here the way to find you
where your other souls are joying
never slumber'd never cloying
here your earth-born souls still speak
to mortals of their little week
of their sorrows and delights
of their passions and their spites
of their glory and their shame
what doth strengthen and what maim --
thus ye teach us every day
wisdom though fled far away
ye have left your souls on earth
ye have souls in heaven too
double-lived in regions new
whatever stirs this mortal frame
all are but ministers of love
and feed his sacred flame
live o'er again that happy hour
when midway on the mount i lay
beside the ruin'd tower
had blended with the lights of eve
and she was there my hope my joy
my own dear genevieve
the statue of the arm d knight
she stood and listen'd to my lay
amid the lingering light
my hope my joy my genevieve
she loves me best whene'er i sing
the songs that make her grieve
i sang an old and moving story--
an old rude song that suited well
that ruin wild and hoary
with downcast eyes and modest grace
for well she knew i could not choose
but gaze upon her face
upon his shield a burning brand
and that for ten long years he woo'd
the lady of the land
the deep the low the pleading tone
with which i sang another's love
interpreted my own
with downcast eyes and modest grace
and she forgave me that i gazed
too fondly on her face
that crazed that bold and lovely knight
and that he cross'd the mountain-woods
nor rested day nor night
and sometimes from the darksome shade
and sometimes starting up at once
in green and sunny glade
an angel beautiful and bright
and that he knew it was a fiend
this miserable knight
he leap'd amid a murderous band
and saved from outrage worse than death
the lady of the land
and how she tended him in vain
and ever strove to expiate
the scorn that crazed his brain
and how his madness went away
when on the yellow forest-leaves
a dying man he lay
that tenderest strain of all the ditty
my faltering voice and pausing harp
disturb'd her soul with pity
had thrill'd my guileless genevieve
the music and the doleful tale
the rich and balmy eve
an undistinguishable throng
and gentle wishes long subdued
subdued and cherish'd long
she blush'd with love and virgin shame
and like the murmur of a dream
i heard her breathe my name
as conscious of my look she stept--
then suddenly with timorous eye
she fled to me and wept
she press'd me with a meek embrace
and bending back her head look'd up
and gazed upon my face
and partly 'twas a bashful art
that i might rather feel than see
the swelling of her heart
and told her love with virgin pride
and so i won my genevieve
my bright and beauteous bride
the days of our youth are the days of our glory
and the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty
are worth all your laurels though ever so plenty
'tis but as a dead flower with may-dew besprinkled
then away with all such from the head that is hoary--
what care i for the wreaths that can only give glory
'twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases
than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover
she thought that i was not unworthy to love her
her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee
when it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story
i knew it was love and i felt it was glory
and greta woods are green
and you may gather garlands there
would grace a summer-queen
and as i rode by dalton-hall
beneath the turrets high
a maiden on the castle-wall
was singing merrily
o brignall banks are fresh and fair
and greta woods are green
i'd rather rove with edmund there
than reign our english queen
to leave both tower and town
thou first must guess what life lead we
that dwell by dale and down
and if thou canst that riddle read
as read full well you may
then to the greenwood shalt thou speed
as blithe as queen of may
yet sung she brignall banks are fair
and greta woods are green
i'd rather rove with edmund there
than reign our english queen
and by your palfrey good
i read you for a ranger sworn
to keep the king's greenwood
a ranger lady winds his horn
and 'tis at peep of light
his blast is heard at merry morn
and mine at dead of night
yet sung she brignall banks are fair
and greta woods are gay
i would i were with edmund there
to reign his queen of may
so gallantly you come
i read you for a bold dragoon
that lists the tuck of drum
i list no more the tuck of drum
no more the trumpet hear
but when the beetle sounds his hum
my comrades take the spear
and o though brignall banks be fair
and greta woods be gay
yet mickle must the maiden dare
would reign my queen of may
a nameless death i'll die
the fiend whose lantern lights the mead
were better mate than i
and when i'm with my comrades met
beneath the greenwood bough
what once we were we all forget
nor think what we are now
and greta woods are green
and you may gather flowers there
would grace a summer-queen
with a magic like thee
and like music on the waters
is thy sweet voice to me
when as if its sound were causing
the charm d ocean's pausing
the waves lie still and gleaming
and the lull'd winds seem dreaming
and the midnight moon is weaving
her bright chain o'er the deep
whose breast is gently heaving
as an infant's asleep
so the spirit bows before thee
to listen and adore thee
with a full but soft emotion
like the swell of summer's ocean
in the first sweet sleep of night
when the winds are breathing low
and the stars are shining bright
i arise from dreams of thee
and a spirit in my feet
hath led me--who knows how
to thy chamber-window sweet
on the dark the silent stream--
the champak odours fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream
the nightingale's complaint
it dies upon her heart
as i must on thine
oh belov d as thou art
i die i faint i fail
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale
my cheek is cold and white alas
my heart beats loud and fast
o press it to thine own again
where it will break at last
of cloudless climes and starry skies
and all that's best of dark and bright
meets in her aspect and her eyes
thus mellow'd to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies
had half impair'd the nameless grace
which waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens o'er her face
where thoughts serenely sweet express
how pure how dear their dwelling-place
so soft so calm yet eloquent
the smiles that win the tints that glow
but tell of days in goodness spent --
a mind at peace with all below
a heart whose love is innocent
when first she gleam'd upon my sight
a lovely apparition sent
to be a moment's ornament
her eyes as stars of twilight fair
like twilight's too her dusky hair
but all things else about her drawn
from may-time and the cheerful dawn
a dancing shape an image gay
to haunt to startle and waylay
a spirit yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin-liberty
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records promises as sweet
a creature not too bright or good
for human nature's daily food
for transient sorrows simple wiles
praise blame love kisses tears and smiles
the very pulse of the machine
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveller between life and death
the reason firm the temperate will
endurance foresight strength and skill
a perfect woman nobly plann'd
to warn to comfort and command
and yet a spirit still and bright
with something of an angel-light
as many maidens be
her loveliness i never knew
until she smiled on me
o then i saw her eye was bright
a well of love a spring of light
to mine they ne'er reply
and yet i cease not to behold
the love-light in her eye
her very frowns are fairer far
than smiles of other maidens are
thou needest not fear mine
my spirit is too deeply laden
ever to burthen thine
thou needest not fear mine
innocent is the heart's devotion
with which i worship thine
beside the springs of dove
a maid whom there were none to praise
and very few to love
half hidden from the eye
--fair as a star when only one
is shining in the sky
when lucy ceased to be
but she is in her grave and o
the difference to me
in lands beyond the sea
nor england did i know till then
what love i bore to thee
nor will i quit thy shore
a second time for still i seem
to love thee more and more
the joy of my desire
and she i cherish'd turn'd her wheel
beside an english fire
the bowers where lucy play'd
and thine too is the last green field
that lucy's eyes survey'd
then nature said a lovelier flower
on earth was never sown
this child i to myself will take
she shall be mine and i will make
a lady of my own
both law and impulse and with me
the girl in rock and plain
in earth and heaven in glade and bower
shall feel an overseeing power
to kindle or restrain
that wild with glee across the lawn
or up the mountain springs
and her's shall be the breathing balm
and her's the silence and the calm
of mute insensate things
to her for her the willow bend
nor shall she fail to see
e'en in the motions of the storm
grace that shall mould the maiden's form
by silent sympathy
to her and she shall lean her ear
in many a secret place
where rivulets dance their wayward round
and beauty born of murmuring sound
shall pass into her face
shall rear her form to stately height
her virgin bosom swell
such thoughts to lucy i will give
while she and i together live
here in this happy dell
how soon my lucy's race was run
she died and left to me
this heath this calm and quiet scene
the memory of what has been
and never more will be
i had no human fears
she seem'd a thing that could not feel
the touch of earthly years
she neither hears nor sees
roll'd round in earth's diurnal course
with rocks and stones and trees
cries boatman do not tarry
and i'll give thee a silver pound
to row us o'er the ferry
this dark and stormy water
o i'm the chief of ulva's isle
and this lord ullin's daughter
three days we've fled together
for should he find us in the glen
my blood would stain the heather
should they our steps discover
then who will cheer my bonny bride
when they have slain her lover
i'll go my chief i'm ready
it is not for your silver bright
but for your winsome lady --
in danger not shall tarry
so though the waves are raging white
i'll row you o'er the ferry
the water-wraith was shrieking
and in the scowl of heaven each face
grew dark as they were speaking
and as the night grew drearer
adown the glen rode arm d men
their trampling sounded nearer
though tempests round us gather
i'll meet the raging of the skies
but not an angry father
a stormy sea before her --
when o too strong for human hand
the tempest gather'd o'er her
of waters fast prevailing
lord ullin reach'd that fatal shore --
his wrath was changed to wailing
his child he did discover --
one lovely hand she stretch'd for aid
and one was round her lover
across this stormy water
and i'll forgive your highland chief
my daughter --o my daughter
return or aid preventing
the waters wild went o'er his child
and he was left lamenting
why weep ye by the tide
i'll wed ye to my youngest son
and ye sall be his bride
and ye sall be his bride ladie
sae comely to be seen --
but aye she loot the tears doon fa'
for jock o' hazeldean
and dry that cheek so pale
young frank is chief of errington
and lord of langley-dale
his step is first in peaceful ha'
his sword in battle keen --
but aye she loot the tears down fa'
for jock o' hazeldean
nor braid to bind your hair
nor mettled hound nor managed hawk
nor palfrey fresh and fair
and you the foremost o' them a'
shall ride our forest queen --
but aye she loot the tears down fa'
for jock o' hazeldean
the tapers glimmer'd fair
the priest and bridegroom wait the bride
and dame and knight are there
they sought her baith by bower and ha'
the ladie was not seen
she's o'er the border and awa'
wi' jock o' hazeldean
of a kiss at love's beginning
when two mutual hearts are sighing
for the knot there's no untying
love has bliss but love has ruing
other smiles may make you fickle
tears for other charms may trickle
just as fate or fancy carries
longest stays when sorest chidden
laughs and flies when press'd and bidden
bind its odour to the lily
bind the aspen ne'er to quiver
then bind love to last for ever
of fresh beauty for its fuel
love's wing moults when caged and captured
only free he soars enraptured
or the ringdove's neck from changing
no nor fetter'd love from dying
in the knot there's no untying
and the rivers with the ocean
the winds of heaven mix for ever
with a sweet emotion
nothing in the world is single
all things by a law divine
in one another's being mingle--
why not i with thine
and the waves clasp one another
no sister-flower would be forgiven
if it disdain'd its brother
and the sunlight clasps the earth
and the moonbeams kiss the sea--
what are all these kissings worth
if thou kiss not me
to music at night
when roused by lute or horn she wakes
and far away o'er lawns and lakes
goes answering light
and far more sweet
than e'er beneath the moonlight's star
of horn or lute or soft guitar
the songs repeat
and only then
the sigh that's breathed for one to hear--
is by that one that only dear
breathed back again
the sun has left the lea
the orange-flower perfumes the bower
the breeze is on the sea
the lark his lay who trill'd all day
sits hush'd his partner nigh
breeze bird and flower confess the hour
but where is county guy
her shepherd's suit to hear
to beauty shy by lattice high
sings high-born cavalier
the star of love all stars above
now reigns o'er earth and sky
and high and low the influence know--
but where is county guy
companion of retiring day
why at the closing gates of heaven
beloved star dost thou delay
when soft the tear of twilight flows
so due thy plighted love returns
to chambers brighter than the rose
so kind a star thou seem'st to be
sure some enamour'd orb above
descends and burns to meet with thee
when all unheavenly passions fly
chased by the soul-subduing power
of love's delicious witchery
queen of propitious stars appear
and early rise and long delay
when caroline herself is here
whose trees the sunward summit crown
and wanton flowers that well may court
an angel's feet to tread them down --
thou star of evening's purple dome
that lead'st the nightingale abroad
and guid'st the pilgrim to his home
embalms the soft exhaling dew
where dying winds a sigh bequeath
to kiss the cheek of rosy hue --
her silken tresses darkly flow
and fall upon her brow so fair
like shadows on the mountain snow
in converse sweet to wander far--
o bring with thee my caroline
and thou shalt be my ruling star
spirit of night
out of the misty eastern cave
where all the long and lone daylight
thou wovest dreams of joy and fear
which make thee terrible and dear --
swift be thy flight
star-inwrought
blind with thine hair the eyes of day
kiss her until she be wearied out
then wander o'er city and sea and land
touching all with thine opiate wand--
come long-sought
i sigh'd for thee
when light rode high and the dew was gone
and noon lay heavy on flower and tree
and the weary day turn'd to his rest
lingering like an unloved guest
i sigh'd for thee
wouldst thou me
thy sweet child sleep the filmy-eyed
murmur'd like a noon-tide bee
shall i nestle near thy side
wouldst thou me --and i replied
no not thee
soon too soon--
sleep will come when thou art fled
of neither would i ask the boon
i ask of thee belov d night--
swift be thine approaching flight
come soon soon
of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
of absence withers what was once so fair
is there no debt to pay no boon to grant
bound to thy service with unceasing care--
the mind's least generous wish a mendicant
for nought but what thy happiness could spare
a thousand tender pleasures thine and mine
be left more desolate more dreary cold
than a forsaken bird's-nest fill'd with snow
'mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--
speak that my torturing doubts their end may know
in silence and tears
half broken-hearted
to sever for years
pale grew thy cheek and cold
colder thy kiss
truly that hour foretold
sorrow to this
sunk chill on my brow
it felt like the warning
of what i feel now
thy vows are all broken
and light is thy fame
i hear thy name spoken
and share in its shame
a knell to mine ear
a shudder comes o'er me--
why wert thou so dear
they know not i knew thee
who knew thee too well
long long shall i rue thee
too deeply to tell
in silence i grieve
that thy heart could forget
thy spirit deceive
if i should meet thee
after long years
how should i greet thee --
with silence and tears
too happy happy tree
thy branches ne'er remember
their green felicity
the north cannot undo them
with a sleety whistle through them
nor frozen thawings glue them
from budding at the prime
too happy happy brook
thy bubblings ne'er remember
apollo's summer look
but with a sweet forgetting
they stay their crystal fretting
never never petting
about the frozen time
a gentle girl and boy
but were there ever any
writhed not at pass d joy
to know the change and feel it
when there is none to heal it
nor numb d sense to steal it--
was never said in rhyme
whom the fates sever
from his true maiden's breast
parted for ever
where through groves deep and high
sounds the far billow
where early violets die
under the willow
eleu loro
soft shall be his pillow
cool streams are laving
there while the tempests sway
scarce are boughs waving
there thy rest shalt thou take
parted for ever
never again to wake
never o never
eleu loro
never o never
he the deceiver
who would win maiden's breast
ruin and leave her
in the lost battle
borne down by the flying
where mingles war's rattle
with groans of the dying
eleu loro
there shall he be lying
o'er the falsehearted
his warm blood the wolf shall lap
ere life be parted
shame and dishonour sit
by his grave ever
blessing shall hallow it
never o never
eleu loro
never o never
alone and palely loitering
the sedge has wither'd from the lake
and no birds sing
so haggard and so woe-begone
the squirrel's granary is full
and the harvest's done
with anguish moist and fever-dew
and on thy cheeks a fading rose
fast withereth too
full beautiful--a faery's child
her hair was long her foot was light
and her eyes were wild
and bracelets too and fragrant zone
she look'd at me as she did love
and made sweet moan
and nothing else saw all day long
for sidelong would she bend and sing
a faery's song
and honey wild and manna-dew
and sure in language strange she said
'i love thee true '
and there she wept and sigh'd full sore
and there i shut her wild wild eyes
with kisses four
and there i dream'd--ah woe betide
the latest dream i ever dream'd
on the cold hill's side
pale warriors death-pale were they all
they cried--'la belle dame sans merci
hath thee in thrall '
with horrid warning gap d wide
and i awoke and found me here
on the cold hill's side
alone and palely loitering
though the sedge is wither'd from the lake
and no birds sing
a weary lot is thine
to pull the thorn thy brow to braid
and press the rue for wine
a lightsome eye a soldier's mien
a feather of the blue
a doublet of the lincoln green--
no more of me you knew
my love
no more of me you knew
the rose is budding fain
but she shall bloom in winter snow
ere we two meet again
he turn'd his charger as he spake
upon the river shore
he gave the bridle-reins a shake
said adieu for evermore
my love
and adieu for evermore
the light in the dust lies dead--
when the cloud is scatter'd
the rainbow's glory is shed
when the lute is broken
sweet tones are remember'd not
when the lips have spoken
loved accents are soon forgot
survive not the lamp and the lute
the heart's echoes render
no song when the spirit is mute--
no song but sad dirges
like the wind through a ruin'd cell
or the mournful surges
that ring the dead seaman's knell
love first leaves the well-built nest
the weak one is singled
to endure what it once possest
o love who bewailest
the frailty of all things here
why choose you the frailest
for your cradle your home and your bier
as the storms rock the ravens on high
bright reason will mock thee
like the sun from a wintry sky
from thy nest every rafter
will rot and thine eagle home
leave thee naked to laughter
when leaves fall and cold winds come
and lovers' ears in hearing
and love in life's extremity
can lend an hour of cheering
disease had been in mary's bower
and slow decay from mourning
though now she sits on neidpath's tower
to watch her love's returning
her form decay'd by pining
till through her wasted hand at night
you saw the taper shining
by fits a sultry hectic hue
across her cheek was flying
by fits so ashy pale she grew
her maidens thought her dying
seem'd in her frame residing
before the watch-dog prick'd his ear
she heard her lover's riding
ere scarce a distant form was kenn'd
she knew and waved to greet him
and o'er the battlement did bend
as on the wing to meet him
as o'er some stranger glancing
her welcome spoke in faltering phrase
lost in his courser's prancing--
returns each whisper spoken
could scarcely catch the feeble moan
which told her heart was broken
and smit with grief to view her--
the youth he cried whom i exiled
shall be restored to woo her
his coming to discover
and he look'd up to ellen's bower
and she look'd on her lover--
though her smile on him was dwelling--
and am i then forgot--forgot
it broke the heart of ellen
her cheek is cold as ashes
nor love's own kiss shall wake those eyes
to lift their silken lashes
not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
and watching with eternal lids apart
like nature's patient sleepless eremite
of pure ablution round earth's human shores
or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
of snow upon the mountains and the moors --
pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast
to feel for ever its soft fall and swell
awake for ever in a sweet unrest
and so live ever --or else swoon to death
before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain
before high-pil d books in charact'ry
hold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain
huge cloudy symbols of a high romance
and think that i may never live to trace
their shadows with the magic hand of chance
that i shall never look upon thee more
never have relish in the fairy power
of unreflecting love--then on the shore
till love and fame to nothingness do sink
i turn'd to share the transport--oh with whom
but thee--deep buried in the silent tomb
that spot which no vicissitude can find
but how could i forget thee through what power
even for the least division of an hour
have i been so beguiled as to be blind
was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore
save one one only when i stood forlorn
that neither present time nor years unborn
could to my sight that heavenly face restore
i fly
to the lone vale we loved when life shone warm in
thine eye
and i think oft if spirits can steal from the regions
of air
to revisit past scenes of delight thou wilt come to
me there
and tell me our love is remember'd even in the sky
when our voices commingling breathed like one on
the ear
and as echo far off through the vale my sad orison
rolls
i think o my love 'tis thy voice from the kingdom
of souls
faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear
as aught of mortal birth
and forms so soft and charms so rare
too soon return'd to earth
though earth received them in her bed
and o'er the spot the crowd may tread
in carelessness or mirth
there is an eye which could not brook
a moment on that grave to look
nor gaze upon the spot
there flowers and weeds at will may grow
so i behold them not
it is enough for me to prove
that what i loved and long must love
like common earth can rot
to me there needs no stone to tell
'tis nothing that i loved so well
as fervently as thou
who didst not change through all the past
and canst not alter now
the love where death has set his seal
nor age can chill nor rival steal
nor falsehood disavow
and what were worse thou canst not see
or wrong or change or fault in me
the worst can be but mine
the sun that cheers the storm that lours
shall never more be thine
the silence of that dreamless sleep
i envy now too much to weep
nor need i to repine
that all those charms have pass'd away
i might have watch'd through long decay
must fall the earliest prey
though by no hand untimely snatch'd
the leaves must drop away
and yet it were a greater grief
to watch it withering leaf by leaf
than see it pluck'd to-day
since earthly eye but ill can bear
to trace the change from foul to fair
to see thy beauties fade
the night that follow'd such a morn
had worn a deeper shade
thy day without a cloud hath past
and thou wert lovely to the last
extinguish'd not decay'd
as stars that shoot along the sky
shine brightest as they fall from high
my tears might well be shed
to think i was not near to keep
one vigil o'er thy bed
to gaze how fondly on thy face
to fold thee in a faint embrace
uphold thy drooping head
and show that love however vain
nor thou nor i can feel again
though thou hast left me free
the loveliest things that still remain
than thus remember thee
the all of thine that cannot die
through dark and dread eternity
returns again to me
and more thy buried love endears
than aught except its living years
for me to profane it
one feeling too falsely disdain'd
for thee to disdain it
one hope is too like despair
for prudence to smother
and pity from thee more dear
than that from another
but wilt thou accept not
the worship the heart lifts above
and the heavens reject not
the desire of the moth for the star
of the night for the morrow
the devotion to something afar
from the sphere of our sorrow
pibroch of donuil
wake thy wild voice anew
summon clan conuil
come away come away
hark to the summons
come in your war-array
gentles and commons
from mountain so rocky
the war-pipe and pennon
are at inverlochy
come every hill-plaid and
true heart that wears one
come every steel blade and
strong hand that bears one
the flock without shelter
leave the corpse uninterr'd
the bride at the altar
leave the deer leave the steer
leave nets and barges
come with your fighting gear
broadswords and targes
forests are rended
come as the waves come when
navies are stranded
faster come faster come
faster and faster
chief vassal page and groom
tenant and master
see how they gather
wide waves the eagle plume
blended with heather
cast your plaids draw your blades
forward each man set
pibroch of donuil dhu
knell for the onset
a wind that follows fast
and fills the white and rustling sail
and bends the gallant mast
and bends the gallant mast my boys
while like the eagle free
away the good ship flies and leaves
old england on the lee
i heard a fair one cry
but give to me the snoring breeze
and white waves heaving high
and white waves heaving high my lads
the good ship tight and free--
the world of waters is our home
and merry men are we
and lightning in yon cloud
but hark the music mariners
the wind is piping loud
the wind is piping loud my boys
the lightning flashes free--
while the hollow oak our palace is
our heritage the sea
that guard our native seas
whose flag has braved a thousand years
the battle and the breeze
your glorious standard launch again
to match another foe
and sweep through the deep
while the stormy winds do blow
while the battle rages loud and long
and the stormy winds do blow
shall start from every wave--
for the deck it was their field of fame
and ocean was their grave
where blake and mighty nelson fell
your manly hearts shall glow
as ye sweep through the deep
while the stormy winds do blow
while the battle rages loud and long
and the stormy winds do blow
no towers along the steep
her march is o'er the mountain waves
her home is on the deep
with thunders from her native oak
she quells the floods below--
as they roar on the shore
when the stormy winds do blow
when the battle rages loud and long
and the stormy winds do blow
shall yet terrific burn
till danger's troubled night depart
and the star of peace return
then then ye ocean-warriors
our song and feast shall flow
to the fame of your name
when the storm has ceased to blow
when the fiery fight is heard no more
and the storm has ceased to blow
sing the glorious day's renown
when to battle fierce came forth
all the might of denmark's crown
and her arms along the deep proudly shone
by each gun the lighted brand
in a bold determined hand
and the prince of all the land
led them on
lay their bulwarks on the brine
while the sign of battle flew
on the lofty british line
it was ten of april morn by the chime
as they drifted on their path
there was silence deep as death
and the boldest held his breath
for a time
to anticipate the scene
and her van the fleeter rush'd
o'er the deadly space between
hearts of oak our captains cried when each gun
from its adamantine lips
spread a death-shade round the ships
like the hurricane eclipse
of the sun
and the havoc did not slack
till a feeble cheer the dane
to our cheering sent us back --
their shots along the deep slowly boom --
then ceased--and all is wail
as they strike the shatter'd sail
or in conflagration pale
light the gloom
as he hail'd them o'er the wave
ye are brothers ye are men
and we conquer but to save --
so peace instead of death let us bring
but yield proud foe thy fleet
with the crews at england's feet
and make submission meet
to our king
that he gave her wounds repose
and the sounds of joy and grief
from her people wildly rose
as death withdrew his shades from the day
while the sun look'd smiling bright
o'er a wide and woeful sight
where the fires of funeral light
died away
for the tidings of thy might
by the festal cities' blaze
whilst the wine-cup shines in light
and yet amidst that joy and uproar
let us think of them that sleep
full many a fathom deep
by thy wild and stormy steep
elsinore
once so faithful and so true
on the deck of fame that died
with the gallant good riou
soft sigh the winds of heaven o'er their grave
while the billow mournful rolls
and the mermaid's song condoles
singing glory to the souls
of the brave
o duty if that name thou love
who art a light to guide a rod
to check the erring and reprove
thou who art victory and law
when empty terrors overawe
from vain temptations dost set free
and calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity
be on them who in love and truth
where no misgiving is rely
upon the genial sense of youth
glad hearts without reproach or blot
who do thy work and know it not
oh if through confidence misplaced
they fail thy saving arms dread power around them cast
and happy will our nature be
when love is an unerring light
and joy its own security
and they a blissful course may hold
ev'n now who not unwisely bold
live in the spirit of this creed
yet find that other strength according to their need
no sport of every random gust
yet being to myself a guide
too blindly have reposed my trust
and oft when in my heart was heard
thy timely mandate i deferr'd
the task in smoother walks to stray
but thee i now would serve more strictly if i may
or strong compunction in me wrought
i supplicate for thy controul
but in the quietness of thought
me this uncharter'd freedom tires
i feel the weight of chance desires
my hopes no more must change their name
i long for a repose which ever is the same
the godhead's most benignant grace
nor know we anything so fair
as is the smile upon thy face
flowers laugh before thee on their beds
and fragrance in thy footing treads
thou dost preserve the stars from wrong
and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong
i call thee i myself commend
unto thy guidance from this hour
o let my weakness have an end
give unto me made lowly wise
the spirit of self-sacrifice
the confidence of reason give
and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live
brightest in dungeons liberty thou art--
for there thy habitation is the heart--
the heart which love of thee alone can bind
to fetters and the damp vault's dayless gloom
their country conquers with their martyrdom
and freedom's fame finds wings on every wind
and thy sad floor an altar for 'twas trod
until his very steps have left a trace
by bonnivard may none those marks efface
for they appeal from tyranny to god
one of the mountains each a mighty voice
in both from age to age thou didst rejoice
they were thy chosen music liberty
thou fought'st against him --but hast vainly striven
thou from thy alpine holds at length are driven
where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee
then cleave o cleave to that which still is left--
for high-soul'd maid what sorrow would it be
and ocean bellow from his rocky shore
and neither awful voice be heard by thee
and was the safeguard of the west the worth
of venice did not fall below her birth
venice the eldest child of liberty
no guile seduced no force could violate
and when she took unto herself a mate
she must espouse the everlasting sea
those titles vanish and that strength decay --
yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
men are we and must grieve when even the shade
of that which once was great has pass'd away
for comfort being as i am opprest
to think that now our life is only drest
for show mean handiwork of craftsman cook
in the open sunshine or we are unblest
the wealthiest man among us is the best
no grandeur now in nature or in book
this is idolatry and these we adore
plain living and high thinking are no more
is gone our peace our fearful innocence
and pure religion breathing household laws
england hath need of thee she is a fen
of stagnant waters altar sword and pen
fireside the heroic wealth of hall and bower
of inward happiness we are selfish men
o raise us up return to us again
and give us manners virtue freedom power
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens majestic free
in cheerful godliness and yet thy heart
the lowliest duties on herself did lay
great nations how ennobling thoughts depart
when men change swords for ledgers and desert
the student's bower for gold --some fears unnamed
now when i think of thee and what thou art
verily in the bottom of my heart
of those unfilial fears i am ashamed
in thee a bulwark of the cause of men
and i by my affection was beguiled
among the many movements of his mind
felt for thee as a lover or a child
all bloodless lay the untrodden snow
and dark as winter was the flow
of iser rolling rapidly
when the drum beat at dead of night
commanding fires of death to light
the darkness of her scenery
each horseman drew his battle-blade
and furious every charger neigh'd
to join the dreadful revelry
then rush'd the steed to battle driven
and louder than the bolts of heaven
far flash'd the red artillery
on linden's hills of stain d snow
and bloodier yet the torrent flow
of iser rolling rapidly
can pierce the war-clouds rolling dun
where furious frank and fiery hun
shout in their sulphurous canopy
who rush to glory or the grave
wave munich all thy banners wave
and charge with all thy chivalry
the snow shall be their winding-sheet
and every turf beneath their feet
shall be a soldier's sepulchre
old kaspar's work was done
and he before his cottage door
was sitting in the sun
and by him sported on the green
his little grandchild wilhelmine
roll something large and round
which he beside the rivulet
in playing there had found
he came to ask what he had found
that was so large and smooth and round
who stood expectant by
and then the old man shook his head
and with a natural sigh
'tis some poor fellow's skull said he
who fell in the great victory
for there's many here about
and often when i go to plough
the ploughshare turns them out
for many thousand men said he
were slain in that great victory
young peterkin he cries
and little wilhelmine looks up
with wonder-waiting eyes
now tell us all about the war
and what they fought each other for
who put the french to rout
but what they fought each other for
i could not well make out
but every body said quoth he
that 'twas a famous victory
yon little stream hard by
they burnt his dwelling to the ground
and he was forced to fly
so with his wife and child he fled
nor had he where to rest his head
was wasted far and wide
and many a childing mother then
and newborn baby died
but things like that you know must be
at every famous victory
after the field was won
for many thousand bodies here
lay rotting in the sun
but things like that you know must be
after a famous victory
and our good prince eugene
why 'twas a very wicked thing
said little wilhelmine
nay--nay--my little girl quoth he
it was a famous victory
who this great fight did win
but what good came of it at last
quoth little peterkin --
why that i cannot tell said he
but 'twas a famous victory
of his fault and his sorrows behind
o say wilt thou weep when they darken the fame
of a life that for thee was resign'd
yes weep and however my foes may condemn
thy tears shall efface their decree
for heaven can witness though guilty to them
i have been but too faithful to thee
every thought of my reason was thine
in my last humble prayer to the spirit above
thy name shall be mingled with mine
o blest are the lovers and friends who shall live
the days of thy glory to see
but the next dearest blessing that heaven can give
is the pride of thus dying for thee
as his corpse to the rampart we hurried
not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
o'er the grave where our hero we buried
the sods with our bayonets turning
by the struggling moonbeam's misty light
and the lantern dimly burning
not in sheet or in shroud we wound him
but he lay like a warrior taking his rest
with his martial cloak around him
and we spoke not a word of sorrow
but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead
and we bitterly thought of the morrow
and smooth'd down his lonely pillow
that the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head
and we far away on the billow
and o'er his cold ashes upbraid him--
but little he'll reck if they let him sleep on
in the grave where a briton has laid him
when the clock struck the hour for retiring
and we heard the distant and random gun
that the foe was sullenly firing
from the field of his fame fresh and gory
we carved not a line and we raised not a stone
but we left him alone with his glory
not far from pleasant ivor hall
an old man dwells a little man
i've heard he once was tall
full five-and-thirty years he lived
a running huntsman merry
and still the centre of his cheek
is red as a ripe cherry
and hill and valley rang with glee
when echo bandied round and round
the halloo of simon lee
in those proud days he little cared
for husbandry or tillage
to blither tasks did simon rouse
the sleepers of the village
could leave both man and horse behind
and often ere the chase was done
he reel'd and was stone-blind
and still there's something in the world
at which his heart rejoices
for when the chiming hounds are out
he dearly loves their voices
of health strength friends and kindred see
old simon to the world is left
in liveried poverty
his master's dead and no one now
dwells in the hall of ivor
men dogs and horses all are dead
he is the sole survivor
his body dwindled and awry
rests upon ankles swoln and thick
his legs are thin and dry
he has no son he has no child
his wife an aged woman
lives with him near the waterfall
upon the village common
not twenty paces from the door
a scrap of land they have but they
are poorest of the poor
this scrap of land he from the heath
enclosed when he was stronger
but what avails the land to them
which he can till no longer
ruth does what simon cannot do
for she with scanty cause for pride
is stouter of the two
and though you with your utmost skill
from labour could not wean them
'tis little very little all
that they can do between them
as he to you will tell
for still the more he works the more
do his weak ankles swell
my gentle reader i perceive
how patiently you've waited
and now i fear that you expect
some tale will be related
such stores as silent thought can bring
o gentle reader you would find
a tale in everything
what more i have to say is short
and you must kindly take it
it is no tale but should you think
perhaps a tale you'll make it
this old man doing all he could
to unearth the root of an old tree
a stump of rotten wood
the mattock totter'd in his hand
so vain was his endeavour
that at the root of the old tree
he might have work'd for ever
give me your tool to him i said
and at the word right gladly he
received my proffer'd aid
i struck and with a single blow
the tangled root i sever'd
at which the poor old man so long
and vainly had endeavour'd
and thanks and praises seem'd to run
so fast out of his heart i thought
they never would have done
--i've heard of hearts unkind kind deeds
with coldness still returning
alas the gratitude of men
has oftener left me mourning
in my days of childhood in my joyful school-days
all all are gone the old familiar faces
drinking late sitting late with my bosom cronies
all all are gone the old familiar faces
closed are her doors on me i must not see her--
all all are gone the old familiar faces
like an ingrate i left my friend abruptly
left him to muse on the old familiar faces
earth seem'd a desert i was bound to traverse
seeking to find the old familiar faces
why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling
so might we talk of the old familiar faces
and some are taken from me all are departed
all all are gone the old familiar faces
against the wind was cleaving
her trembling pennant still look'd back
to that dear isle 'twas leaving
so loth we part from all we love
from all the links that bind us
so turn our hearts as on we rove
to those we've left behind us
we talk with joyous seeming--
with smiles that might as well be tears
so faint so sad their beaming
while memory brings us back again
each early tie that twined us
oh sweet's the cup that circles then
to those we've left behind us
some isle or vale enchanting
where all looks flowery wild and sweet
and nought but love is wanting
we think how great had been our bliss
if heaven had but assign'd us
to live and die in scenes like this
with some we've left behind us
when eastward darkly going
to gaze upon that light they leave
still faint behind them glowing --
so when the close of pleasure's day
to gloom hath near consign'd us
we turn to catch our fading ray
of joy that's left behind us
when the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay
'tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone which fades so fast
but the tender bloom of heart is gone ere youth itself be past
are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess
the magnet of their course is gone or only points in vain
the shore to which their shiver'd sail shall never stretch again
it cannot feel for others' woes it dare not dream its own
that heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears
and though the eye may sparkle still 'tis where the ice appears
through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest
'tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruin'd turret wreathe
all green and wildly fresh without but worn and gray beneath
or weep as i could once have wept o'er many a vanish'd scene --
as springs in deserts found seem sweet all brackish though they be
so midst the wither'd waste of life those tears would flow to me
that shrinks like many more from cold and rain
and the first moment that the sun may shine
bright as the sun himself 'tis out again
or blasts the green field and the trees distrest
oft have i seen it muffled up from harm
in close self-shelter like a thing at rest
and recognised it though an alter'd form
now standing forth an offering to the blast
and buffeted at will by rain and storm
it doth not love the shower nor seek the cold
this neither is its courage nor its choice
but its necessity in being old
it cannot help itself in its decay
stiff in its members wither'd changed of hue
and in my spleen i smiled that it was gray
a miser's pensioner--behold our lot
o man that from thy fair and shining youth
age might but take the things youth needed not
the house where i was born
the little window where the sun
came peeping in at morn
he never came a wink too soon
nor brought too long a day
but now i often wish the night
had borne my breath away
the roses red and white
the violets and the lily-cups--
those flowers made of light
the lilacs where the robin built
and where my brother set
the laburnum on his birthday --
the tree is living yet
where i was used to swing
and thought the air must rush as fresh
to swallows on the wing
my spirit flew in feathers then
that is so heavy now
and summer pools could hardly cool
the fever on my brow
the fir trees dark and high
i used to think their slender tops
were close against the sky
it was a childish ignorance
but now 'tis little joy
to know i'm farther off from heaven
than when i was a boy
ere slumber's chain has bound me
fond memory brings the light
of other days around me
the smiles the tears
of boyhood's years
the words of love then spoken
the eyes that shone
now dimm'd and gone
the cheerful hearts now broken
thus in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me
the friends so link'd together
i've seen around me fall
like leaves in wintry weather
i feel like one
who treads alone
some banquet-hall deserted
whose lights are fled
whose garlands dead
and all but he departed
thus in the stilly night
ere slumber's chain has bound me
sad memory brings the light
of other days around me
spirit of delight
wherefore hast thou left me now
many a day and night
many a weary night and day
'tis since thou art fled away
win thee back again
with the joyous and the free
thou wilt scoff at pain
spirit false thou hast forgot
all but those who need thee not
of a trembling leaf
thou with sorrow art dismay'd
even the sighs of grief
reproach thee that thou art not near
and reproach thou wilt not hear
to a merry measure --
thou wilt never come for pity
thou wilt come for pleasure --
pity then will cut away
those cruel wings and thou wilt stay
spirit of delight
the fresh earth in new leaves drest
and the starry night
autumn evening and the morn
when the golden mists are born
of the radiant frost
i love waves and winds and storms
everything almost
which is nature's and may be
untainted by man's misery
and such society
as is quiet wise and good
between thee and me
what diff'rence but thou dost possess
the things i seek not love them less
and like light can flee
but above all other things
spirit i love thee--
thou art love and life o come
make once more my heart thy home
the waves are dancing fast and bright
blue isles and snowy mountains wear
the purple noon's transparent light
the breath of the moist air is light
around its unexpanded buds
like many a voice of one delight--
the winds' the birds' the ocean-floods'--
the city's voice itself is soft like solitude's
with green and purple sea-weeds strown
i see the waves upon the shore
like light dissolved in star-showers thrown
i sit upon the sands alone
the lightning of the noon-tide ocean
is flashing round me and a tone
arises from its measured motion--
how sweet did any heart now share in my emotion
nor peace within nor calm around
nor that content surpassing wealth
the sage in meditation found
and walked with inward glory crown'd--
nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure
others i see whom these surround--
smiling they live and call life pleasure
to me that cup has been dealt in another measure
even as the winds and waters are
i could lie down like a tired child
and weep away the life of care
which i have borne and yet must bear
till death like sleep might steal on me
and i might feel in the warm air
my cheek grow cold and hear the sea
breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony
around me i behold
where'er these casual eyes are cast
the mighty minds of old
my never-failing friends are they
with whom i converse day by day
and seek relief in woe
and while i understand and feel
how much to them i owe
my cheeks have often been bedew'd
with tears of thoughtful gratitude
i live in long-past years
their virtues love their faults condemn
partake their hopes and fears
and from their lessons seek and find
instruction with an humble mind
my place with them will be
and i with them shall travel on
through all futurity
yet leaving here a name i trust
that will not perish in the dust
what elysium have ye known
happy field or mossy cavern
choicer than the mermaid tavern
have ye tippled drink more fine
than mine host's canary wine
or are fruits of paradise
sweeter than those dainty pies
of venison o generous food
drest as though bold robin hood
would with his maid marian
sup and browse from horn and can
mine host's signboard flew away
nobody knew whither till
an astrologer's old quill
to a sheepskin gave the story--
said he saw you in your glory
underneath a new-old sign
sipping beverage divine
and pledging with contented smack
the mermaid in the zodiac
souls of poets dead and gone
what elysium have ye known--
happy field or mossy cavern--
choicer than the mermaid tavern
walking so early
sweet robin sits on the bush
singing so rarely
when shall i marry me
-- when six braw gentlemen
kirkward shall carry ye
birdie say truly
-- the gray-headed sexton
that delves the grave duly
shall light thee steady
the owl from the steeple sing
welcome proud lady
weary of breath
rashly importunate
gone to her death
lift her with care
fashion'd so slenderly
young and so fair
clinging like cerements
whilst the wave constantly
drips from her clothing
take her up instantly
loving not loathing
think of her mournfully
gently and humanly
not of the stains of her--
all that remains of her
now is pure womanly
into her mutiny
rash and undutiful
past all dishonour
death has left on her
only the beautiful
one of eve's family--
wipe those poor lips of hers
oozing so clammily
escaped from the comb
her fair auburn tresses
whilst wonderment guesses
where was her home
who was her mother
had she a sister
had she a brother
or was there a dearer one
still and a nearer one
yet than all other
of christian charity
under the sun
o it was pitiful
near a whole city full
home she had none
fatherly motherly
feelings had changed
love by harsh evidence
thrown from its eminence
even god's providence
seeming estranged
so far in the river
with many a light
from window and casement
from garret to basement
she stood with amazement
houseless by night
made her tremble and shiver
but not the dark arch
or the black flowing river
mad from life's history
glad to death's mystery
swift to be hurl'd--
any where any where
out of the world
no matter how coldly
the rough river ran
over the brink of it --
picture it think of it
dissolute man
lave in it drink of it
then if you can
lift her with care
fashion'd so slenderly
young and so fair
stiffen too rigidly
decently kindly
smooth and compose them
and her eyes close them
staring so blindly
thro' muddy impurity
as when with the daring
last look of despairing
fix'd on futurity
spurr'd by contumely
cold inhumanity
burning insanity
into her rest
--cross her hands humbly
as if praying dumbly
over her breast
her evil behaviour
and leaving with meekness
her sins to her saviour
on thee shall press no ponderous tomb
but on thy turf shall roses rear
their leaves the earliest of the year
and the wild cypress wave in tender gloom
shall sorrow lean her drooping head
and feed deep thought with many a dream
and lingering pause and lightly tread
fond wretch as if her step disturb'd the dead
that death nor heeds nor hears distress
will this unteach us to complain
or make one mourner weep the less
and thou who tell'st me to forget
thy looks are wan thine eyes are wet
their place ye may not well supply
though ye among a thousand try
with vain endeavour
a month or more hath she been dead
yet cannot i by force be led
to think upon the wormy bed
and her together
a rising step did indicate
of pride and joy no common rate
that flush'd her spirit
i know not by what name beside
i shall it call if 'twas not pride
it was a joy to that allied
she did inherit
which doth the human feeling cool
but she was train'd in nature's school
nature had blest her
a waking eye a prying mind
a heart that stirs is hard to bind
a hawk's keen sight ye cannot blind
ye could not hester
to that unknown and silent shore
shall we not meet as heretofore
some summer morning--
when from thy cheerful eyes a ray
hath struck a bliss upon the day
a bliss that would not go away
a sweet fore-warning
he is lost to the forest
like a summer-dried fountain
when our need was the sorest
the fount reappearing
from the raindrops shall borrow
but to us comes no cheering
to duncan no morrow
take the ears that are hoary
but the voice of the weeper
wails manhood in glory
the autumn winds rushing
waft the leaves that are serest
but our flower was in flushing
when blighting was nearest
sage counsel in cumber
red hand in the foray
how sound is thy slumber
like the dew on the mountain
like the foam on the river
like the bubble on the fountain
thou art gone and for ever
her breathing soft and low
as in her breast the wave of life
kept heaving to and fro
and chill with early showers
her quiet eyelids closed--she had
another morn than ours
no haughty feat of arms i tell
soft is the note and sad the lay
that mourns the lovely rosabelle
and gentle lady deign to stay
rest thee in castle ravensheuch
nor tempt the stormy firth to-day
to inch and rock the sea-mews fly
the fishers have heard the water-sprite
whose screams forbode that wreck is nigh
a wet shroud swathed round lady gay
then stay thee fair in ravensheuch
why cross the gloomy firth to-day
to-night at roslin leads the ball
but that my lady-mother there
sits lonely in her castle-hall
and lindesay at the ring rides well
but that my sire the wine will chide
if 'tis not fill'd by rosabelle
a wondrous blaze was seen to gleam
'twas broader than the watch-fire's light
and redder than the bright moonbeam
it ruddied all the copse-wood glen
'twas seen from dryden's grove of oak
and seen from cavern'd hawthornden
where roslin's chiefs uncoffin'd lie
each baron for a sabled shroud
sheathed in his iron panoply
deep sacristy and altar's pale
shone every pillar foliage-bound
and glimmer'd all the dead men's mail
blazed every rose-carved buttress fair--
so still they blaze when fate is nigh
the lordly line of high saint clair
lie buried within that proud chapelle
each one the holy vault doth hold
but the sea holds lovely rosabelle
with candle with book and with knell
but the sea-caves rung and the wild winds sung
the dirge of lovely rosabelle
a curious frame of nature's work
a flow'ret crush d in the bud
a nameless piece of babyhood
was in her cradle-coffin lying
extinct with scarce the sense of dying
so soon to exchange the imprisoning womb
for darker closets of the tomb
she did but ope an eye and put
a clear beam forth then straight up shut
for the long dark ne'er more to see
through glasses of mortality
riddle of destiny who can show
what thy short visit meant or know
what thy errand here below
shall we say that nature blind
check'd her hand and changed her mind
just when she had exactly wrought
a finish'd pattern without fault
could she flag or could she tire
or lack'd she the promethean fire
with her nine moons' long workings sicken'd
that should thy little limbs have quicken'd
limbs so firm they seem'd to assure
life of health and days mature
woman's self in miniature
limbs so fair they might supply
themselves now but cold imagery
the sculptor to make beauty by
or did the stern-eyed fate descry
that babe or mother one must die
so in mercy left the stock
and cut the branch to save the shock
of young years widow'd and the pain
when single state comes back again
to the lone man who reft of wife
thenceforward drags a maim d life
the economy of heaven is dark
and wisest clerks have miss'd the mark
why human buds like this should fall
more brief than fly ephemeral
that has his day while shrivell'd crones
stiffen with age to stocks and stones
and crabb d use the conscience sears
in sinners of an hundred years
--mother's prattle mother's kiss
baby fond thou ne'er wilt miss
rites which custom does impose
silver bells and baby clothes
coral redder than those lips
which pale death did late eclipse
music framed for infants' glee
whistle never tuned for thee
though thou want'st not thou shalt have them
loving hearts were they which gave them
let not one be missing nurse
see them laid upon the hearse
of infant slain by doom perverse
why should kings and nobles have
pictured trophies to their grave
and we churls to thee deny
thy pretty toys with thee to lie--
a more harmless vanity
where art thou worse to me than dead
oh find me prosperous or undone
or if the grave be now thy bed
why am i ignorant of the same
that i may rest and neither blame
nor sorrow may attend thy name
no tidings of an only child--
to have despair'd have hoped believed
and be for evermore beguiled --
sometimes with thoughts of very bliss
i catch at them and then i miss
was ever darkness like to this
an object beauteous to behold
well born well bred i sent him forth
ingenuous innocent and bold
if things ensued that wanted grace
as hath been said they were not base
and never blush was on my face
when full of play and childish cares
what power is in his wildest scream
heard by his mother unawares
he knows it not he cannot guess
years to a mother bring distress
but do not make her love the less
from that ill thought and being blind
said pride shall help me in my wrong
kind mother have i been as kind
as ever breathed and that is true
i've wet my path with tears like dew
weeping for him when no one knew
hopeless of honour and of gain
o do not dread thy mother's door
think not of me with grief and pain
i now can see with better eyes
and worldly grandeur i despise
and fortune with her gifts and lies
and blasts of heaven will aid their flight
they mount--how short a voyage brings
the wanderers back to their delight
chains tie us down by land and sea
and wishes vain as mine may be
all that is left to comfort thee
maim'd mangled by inhuman men
or thou upon a desert thrown
inheritest the lion's den
or hast been summoned to the deep
thou thou and all thy mates to keep
an incommunicable sleep
their way to me 'tis falsely said
that there was ever intercourse
between the living and the dead
for surely then i should have sight
of him i wait for day and night
with love and longings infinite
i dread the rustling of the grass
the very shadows of the clouds
have power to shake me as they pass
i question things and do not find
one that will answer to my mind
and all the world appears unkind
my troubles and beyond relief
if any chance to heave a sigh
they pity me and not my grief
then come to me my son or send
some tidings that my woes may end
i have no other earthly friend
on the mountain dawns the day
all the jolly chase is here
with hawk and horse and hunting-spear
hounds are in their couples yelling
hawks are whistling horns are knelling
merrily merrily mingle they
waken lords and ladies gay
the mist has left the mountains gray
springlets in the dawn are streaming
diamonds on the brake are gleaming
and foresters have busy been
to track the buck in thicket green
now we come to chant our lay
waken lords and ladies gay
to the greenwood haste away
we can show you where he lies
fleet of foot and tall of size
we can show the marks he made
when 'gainst the oak his antlers fray'd
you shall see him brought to bay
waken lords and ladies gay
waken lords and ladies gay
tell them youth and mirth and glee
run a course as well as we
time stern huntsman who can baulk
staunch as hound and fleet as hawk
think of this and rise with day
gentle lords and ladies gay
dost thou despise the earth where cares abound
or while the wings aspire are heart and eye
both with thy nest upon the dewy ground
thy nest which thou canst drop into at will
those quivering wings composed that music still
mount daring warbler --that love-prompted strain
--'twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond--
thrills not the less the bosom of the plain
yet might'st thou seem proud privilege to sing
all independent of the leafy spring
a privacy of glorious light is thine
whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
of harmony with instinct more divine
type of the wise who soar but never roam--
true to the kindred points of heaven and home
bird thou never wert
that from heaven or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art
from the earth thou springest
like a cloud of fire
the blue deep thou wingest
and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest
of the sunken sun
o'er which clouds are brightening
thou dost float and run
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun
melts around thy flight
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight
of that silver sphere
whose intense lamp narrows
in the white dawn clear
until we hardly see we feel that it is there
with thy voice is loud
as when night is bare
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams and heaven is overflow'd
what is most like thee
from rainbow clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody
in the light of thought
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not
in a palace tower
soothing her love-laden
soul in secret hour
with music sweet as love which overflows her bower
in a dell of dew
scattering unbeholden
its aerial hue
among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view
in its own green leaves
by warm winds deflower'd
till the scent it gives
makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-wing d thieves
on the twinkling grass
rain-awaken'd flowers
all that ever was
joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass
what sweet thoughts are thine
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine
or triumphal chaunt
match'd with thine would be all
but an empty vaunt--
a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want
of thy happy strain
what fields or waves or mountains
what shapes of sky or plain
what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain
languor cannot be
shadow of annoyance
never came near thee
thou lovest but ne'er knew love's sad satiety
thou of death must deem
things more true and deep
than we mortals dream
or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream
and pine for what is not
our sincerest laughter
with some pain is fraught
our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought
hate and pride and fear
if we were things born
not to shed a tear
i know not how thy joy we ever should come near
of delightful sound
better than all treasures
that in books are found
thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground
that thy brain must know
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then as i am listening now
their snow white blossoms on my head
with brightest sunshine round me spread
of spring's unclouded weather
in this sequester'd nook how sweet
to sit upon my orchard-seat
and birds and flowers once more to greet
my last year's friends together
in all this covert of the blest
hail to thee far above the rest
in joy of voice and pinion
thou linnet in thy green array
presiding spirit here to-day
dost lead the revels of the may
and this is thy dominion
make all one band of paramours
thou ranging up and down the bowers
art sole in thy employment
a life a presence like the air
scattering thy gladness without care
too blest with any one to pair
thyself thy own enjoyment
that twinkle to the gusty breeze
behold him perch'd in ecstasies
yet seeming still to hover
there where the flutter of his wings
upon his back and body flings
shadows and sunny glimmerings
that cover him all over
a brother of the dancing leaves
then flits and from the cottage-eaves
pours forth his song in gushes
as if by that exulting strain
he mock'd and treated with disdain
the voiceless form he chose to feign
while fluttering in the bushes
i hear thee and rejoice
o cuckoo shall i call thee bird
or but a wandering voice
thy twofold shout i hear
from hill to hill it seems to pass
at once far off and near
of sunshine and of flowers
thou bringest unto me a tale
of visionary hours
even yet thou art to me
no bird but an invisible thing
a voice a mystery
i listen'd to that cry
which made me look a thousand ways
in bush and tree and sky
through woods and on the green
and thou wert still a hope a love
still long'd for never seen
can lie upon the plain
and listen till i do beget
that golden time again
again appears to be
an unsubstantial fairy place
that is fit home for thee
my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk
or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
one minute past and lethe-wards had sunk
'tis not through envy of thy happy lot
but being too happy in thine happiness --
that thou light-wing d dryad of the trees
in some melodious plot
of beechen green and shadows numberless
singest of summer in full-throated ease
cool'd a long age in the deep-delv d earth
tasting of flora and the country-green
dance and proven al song and sunburnt mirth
o for a beaker full of the warm south
full of the true the blushful hippocrene
with beaded bubbles winking at the brim
and purple-stain d mouth
that i might drink and leave the world unseen
and with thee fade away into the forest dim
what thou among the leaves hast never known
the weariness the fever and the fret
here where men sit and hear each other groan
where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs
where youth grows pale and spectre-thin and dies
where but to think is to be full of sorrow
and leaden-eyed despairs
where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes
or new love pine at them beyond to-morrow
not charioted by bacchus and his pards
but on the viewless wings of poesy
though the dull brain perplexes and retards
already with thee tender is the night
and haply the queen-moon is on her throne
cluster'd around by all her starry fays
but here there is no light
save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways
nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs
but in embalm d darkness guess each sweet
wherewith the seasonable month endows
the grass the thicket and the fruit-tree wild
white hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine
fast-fading violets cover'd up in leaves
and mid-may's eldest child
the coming musk-rose full of dewy wine
the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves
i have been half in love with easeful death
call'd him soft names in many a mus d rhyme
to take into the air my quiet breath
now more than ever seems it rich to die
to cease upon the midnight with no pain
while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
in such an ecstasy
still wouldst thou sing and i have ears in vain--
to thy high requiem become a sod
no hungry generations tread thee down
the voice i hear this passing night was heard
in ancient days by emperor and clown
perhaps the self-same song that found a path
through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home
she stood in tears amid the alien corn
the same that oft-times hath
charm'd magic casements opening on the foam
of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn
to toll me back from thee to my sole self
adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well
as she is famed to do deceiving elf
adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades
past the near meadows over the still stream
up the hill-side and now 'tis buried deep
in the next valley-glades
was it a vision or a waking dream
fled is that music --do i wake or sleep
dull would he be of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in its majesty
this city now doth like a garment wear
the beauty of the morning silent bare
ships towers domes theatres and temples lie
open unto the fields and to the sky
all bright and glittering in the smokeless air
in his first splendour valley rock or hill
ne'er saw i never felt a calm so deep
dear god the very houses seem asleep
and all that mighty heart is lying still
who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert near them on the sand
half sunk a shatter'd visage lies whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive stamp'd on these lifeless things
the hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed
and on the pedestal these words appear
my name is ozymandias king of kings
look on my works ye mighty and despair
nothing beside remains round the decay
of that colossal wreck boundless and bare
the lone and level sands stretch far away
whom mere despite of heart could so far please
and love of havoc for with such disease
fame taxes him that he could send forth word
a brotherhood of venerable trees
leaving an ancient dome and towers like these
beggar'd and outraged --many hearts deplored
the traveller at this day will stop and gaze
on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed
and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed
and the green silent pastures yet remain
--the lovely cottage in the guardian nook
hath stirr'd thee deeply with its own dear brook
its own small pasture almost its own sky
as many do repining while they look
intruders who would tear from nature's book
this precious leaf with harsh impiety
even thine though few thy wants --roof window door
the very flowers are sacred to the poor
yea all that now enchants thee from the day
on which it should be touch'd would melt away
of beauty is thy earthly dower
twice seven consenting years have shed
their utmost bounty on thy head
and these grey rocks this household lawn
these trees--a veil just half withdrawn
this fall of water that doth make
a murmur near the silent lake
this little bay a quiet road
that holds in shelter thy abode
in truth together ye do seem
like something fashion'd in a dream
such forms as from their covert peep
when earthly cares are laid asleep
but o fair creature in the light
of common day so heavenly bright
i bless thee vision as thou art
i bless thee with a human heart
god shield thee to thy latest years
i neither know thee nor thy peers
and yet my eyes are fill'd with tears
for thee when i am far away
for never saw i mien or face
in which more plainly i could trace
benignity and home-bred sense
ripening in perfect innocence
here scatter'd like a random seed
remote from men thou dost not need
the embarrass'd look of shy distress
and maidenly shamefacedness
thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
the freedom of a mountaineer
a face with gladness overspread
soft smiles by human kindness bred
and seemliness complete that sways
thy courtesies about thee plays
with no restraint but such as springs
from quick and eager visitings
of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
of thy few words of english speech
a bondage sweetly brook'd a strife
that gives thy gestures grace and life
so have i not unmoved in mind
seen birds of tempest-loving kind
thus beating up against the wind
for thee who art so beautiful
o happy pleasure here to dwell
beside thee in some heathy dell
adopt your homely ways and dress
a shepherd thou a shepherdess
but i could frame a wish for thee
more like a grave reality
thou art to me but as a wave
of the wild sea and i would have
some claim upon thee if i could
though but of common neighbourhood
what joy to hear thee and to see
thy elder brother i would be
thy father anything to thee
hath led me to this lonely place
joy have i had and going hence
i bear away my recompense
in spots like these it is we prize
our memory feel that she hath eyes
then why should i be loth to stir
i feel this place was made for her
to give new pleasure like the past
continued long as life shall last
nor am i loth though pleased at heart
sweet highland girl from thee to part
for i methinks till i grow old
as fair before me shall behold
as i do now the cabin small
the lake the bay the waterfall
and thee the spirit of them all
yon solitary highland lass
reaping and singing by herself
stop here or gently pass
alone she cuts and binds the grain
and sings a melancholy strain
o listen for the vale profound
is overflowing with the sound
more welcome notes to weary bands
of travellers in some shady haunt
among arabian sands
no sweeter voice was ever heard
in spring-time from the cuckoo-bird
breaking the silence of the seas
among the farthest hebrides
perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
for old unhappy far-off things
and battles long ago
or is it some more humble lay
familiar matter of to-day
some natural sorrow loss or pain
that has been and may be again
as if her song could have no ending
i saw her singing at her work
and o'er the sickle bending
i listen'd till i had my fill
and as i mounted up the hill
the music in my heart i bore
long after it was heard no more
hangs a thrush that sings loud it has sung for three years
poor susan has pass'd by the spot and has heard
in the silence of morning the song of the bird
a mountain ascending a vision of trees
bright volumes of vapour through lothbury glide
and a river flows on through the vale of cheapside
down which she so often has tripp'd with her pail
and a single small cottage a nest like a dove's
the one only dwelling on earth that she loves
the mist and the river the hill and the shade
the stream will not flow and the hill will not rise
and the colours have all pass'd away from her eyes
this slave of music for the sake
of him who is the slave of thee
and teach it all the harmony
in which thou canst and only thou
make the delighted spirit glow
till joy denies itself again
and too intense is turn'd to pain
for by permission and command
of thine own prince ferdinand
poor ariel sends this silent token
of more than ever can be spoken
your guardian spirit ariel who
from life to life must still pursue
your happiness for thus alone
can ariel ever find his own
from prospero's enchanted cell
as the mighty verses tell
to the throne of naples he
lit you o'er the trackless sea
flitting on your prow before
like a living meteor
when you die the silent moon
in her interlunar swoon
is not sadder in her cell
than deserted ariel
when you live again on earth
like an unseen star of birth
ariel guides you o'er the sea
of life from your nativity --
many changes have been run
since ferdinand and you begun
your course of love and ariel still
has track'd your steps and served your will
now in humbler happier lot
this is all remember'd not
and now alas the poor sprite is
imprison'd for some fault of his
in a body like a grave--
from you he only dares to crave
for his service and his sorrow
a smile to-day a song to-morrow
to echo all harmonious thought
fell'd a tree while on the steep
the woods were in their winter sleep
rock'd in that repose divine
on the wind-swept apennine
and dreaming some of autumn past
and some of spring approaching fast
and some of april buds and showers
and some of songs in july bowers
and all of love and so this tree --
o that such our death may be --
died in sleep and felt no pain
to live in happier form again
from which beneath heaven's fairest star
the artist wrought this loved guitar
and taught it justly to reply
to all who question skilfully
in language gentle as thine own
whispering in enamour'd tone
sweet oracles of woods and dells
and summer winds in sylvan cells
--for it had learnt all harmonies
of the plains and of the skies
of the forests and the mountains
and the many-voic d fountains
the clearest echoes of the hills
the softest notes of falling rills
the melodies of birds and bees
the murmuring of summer seas
and pattering rain and breathing dew
and airs of evening and it knew
that seldom-heard mysterious sound
which driven on its diurnal round
as it floats through boundless day
our world enkindles on its way
--all this it knows but will not tell
to those who cannot question well
the spirit that inhabits it
it talks according to the wit
of its companions and no more
is heard than has been felt before
by those who tempt it to betray
these secrets of an elder day
but sweetly as its answers will
flatter hands of perfect skill
it keeps its highest holiest tone
for one beloved friend alone
that floats on high o'er vales and hills
when all at once i saw a crowd
a host of golden daffodils
beside the lake beneath the trees
fluttering and dancing in the breeze
and twinkle on the milky way
they stretch'd in never-ending line
along the margin of a bay
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance
out-did the sparkling waves in glee --
a poet could not but be gay
in such a jocund company
i gazed--and gazed--but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought
in vacant or in pensive mood
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude
and then my heart with pleasure fills
and dances with the daffodils
of things that in the great world be
sweet daisy oft i talk to thee
for thou art worthy
thou unassuming commonplace
of nature with that homely face
and yet with something of a grace
which love makes for thee
i sit and play with similes
loose types of things through all degrees
thoughts of thy raising
and many a fond and idle name
i give to thee for praise or blame
as is the humour of the game
while i am gazing
or sprightly maiden of love's court
in thy simplicity the sport
of all temptations
a queen in crown of rubies drest
a starveling in a scanty vest
are all as seem to suit thee best
thy appellations
staring to threaten and defy
that thought comes next--and instantly
the freak is over
the shape will vanish and behold
a silver shield with boss of gold
that spreads itself some fairy bold
in fight to cover
and then thou art a pretty star
not quite so fair as many are
in heaven above thee
yet like a star with glittering crest
self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest --
may peace come never to his nest
who shall reprove thee
when all my reveries are past
i call thee and to that cleave fast
sweet silent creature
that breath'st with me in sun and air
do thou as thou art wont repair
my heart with gladness and a share
of thy meek nature
close bosom-friend of the maturing sun
conspiring with him how to load and bless
with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run
to bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees
and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core
to swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells
with a sweet kernel to set budding more
and still more later flowers for the bees
until they think warm days will never cease
for summer has o'erbrimm'd their clammy cells
sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
thee sitting careless on a granary floor
thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind
or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep
drowsed with the fume of poppies while thy hook
spares the next swath and all its twin d flowers
and sometime like a gleaner thou dost keep
steady thy laden head across a brook
or by a cider-press with patient look
thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours
think not of them --thou hast thy music too
while barr d clouds bloom the soft-dying day
and touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue
then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
among the river sallows borne aloft
or sinking as the light wind lives or dies
and full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn
hedge-crickets sing and now with treble soft
the redbreast whistles from a garden croft
and gathering swallows twitter in the skies
his heavenly race began to run
round the earth and ocean blue
his children four the seasons flew --
first in green apparel dancing
the young spring smiled with angel-grace
rosy summer next advancing
rush'd into her sire's embrace--
her bright-hair'd sire who bade her keep
for ever nearest to his smiles
on calpe's olive-shaded steep
or india's citron-cover'd isles
more remote and buxom-brown
the queen of vintage bow'd before his throne
a rich pomegranate gemm'd her crown
a ripe sheaf bound her zone
to hills that prop the polar star
and loves on deer-borne car to ride
with barren darkness at his side
round the shore where loud lofoden
whirls to death the roaring whale
round the hall where runic odin
howls his war-song to the gale--
save when adown the ravaged globe
he travels on his native storm
deflowering nature's grassy robe
and trampling on her faded form
till light's returning lord assume
the shaft that drives him to his northern fields
of power to pierce his raven plume
and crystal-cover'd shield
the lapland drum delights to hear
when frenzy with her bloodshot eye
implores thy dreadful deity--
archangel power of desolation
fast descending as thou art
say hath mortal invocation
spells to touch thy stony heart
then sullen winter hear my prayer
and gently rule the ruin'd year
nor chill the wanderer's bosom bare
nor freeze the wretch's falling tear
to shuddering want's unmantled bed
thy horror-breathing agues cease to lend
and gently on the orphan head
of innocence descend
the sailor on his airy shrouds
when wrecks and beacons strew the deep
and spectres walk along the deep
milder yet thy snowy breezes
pour on yonder tented shores
where the rhine's broad billow freezes
or the dark-brown danube roars
o winds of winter list ye there
to many a deep and dying groan
or start ye demons of the midnight air
at shrieks and thunders louder than your own
alas e'en your unhallow'd breath
may spare the victim fallen low
but man will ask no truce to death
no bounds to human woe
the mazy forth unravell'd
had trod the banks of clyde and tay
and with the tweed had travell'd
and when we came to clovenford
then said my winsome marrow
whate'er betide we'll turn aside
and see the braes of yarrow
who have been buying selling
go back to yarrow 'tis their own
each maiden to her dwelling
on yarrow's banks let herons feed
hares couch and rabbits burrow
but we will downward with the tweed
nor turn aside to yarrow
both lying right before us
and dryburgh where with chiming tweed
the lintwhites sing in chorus
there's pleasant tiviotdale a land
made blythe with plough and harrow
why throw away a needful day
to go in search of yarrow
that glides the dark hills under
there are a thousand such elsewhere
as worthy of your wonder
--strange words they seem'd of slight and scorn
my true-love sighed for sorrow
and look'd me in the face to think
i thus could speak of yarrow
and sweet is yarrow flowing
fair hangs the apple frae the rock
but we will leave it growing
o'er hilly path and open strath
we'll wander scotland thorough
but though so near we will not turn
into the dale of yarrow
the sweets of burn-mill meadow
the swan on still saint mary's lake
float double swan and shadow
we will not see them will not go
to-day nor yet to-morrow
enough if in our hearts we know
there's such a place as yarrow
it must or we shall rue it
we have a vision of our own
ah why should we undo it
the treasured dreams of times long past
we'll keep them winsome marrow
for when we're there although 'tis fair
'twill be another yarrow
and wandering seem but folly --
should we be loth to stir from home
and yet be melancholy
should life be dull and spirits low
'twill soothe us in our sorrow
that earth has something yet to show
the bonny holms of yarrow
of which my fancy cherish'd
so faithfully a waking dream
an image that hath perish'd
o that some minstrel's harp were near
to utter notes of gladness
and chase this silence from the air
that fills my heart with sadness
with uncontroll'd meanderings
nor have these eyes by greener hills
been soothed in all my wanderings
and through her depths saint mary's lake
is visibly delighted
for not a feature of those hills
is in the mirror slighted
save where that pearly whiteness
is round the rising sun diffused
a tender hazy brightness
mild dawn of promise that excludes
all profitless dejection
though not unwilling here to admit
a pensive recollection
of yarrow vale lay bleeding
his bed perchance was yon smooth mound
on which the herd is feeding
and haply from this crystal pool
now peaceful as the morning
the water-wraith ascended thrice
and gave his doleful warning
the haunts of happy lovers
the path that leads them to the grove
the leafy grove that covers
and pity sanctifies the verse
that paints by strength of sorrow
the unconquerable strength of love
bear witness rueful yarrow
to fond imagination
dost rival in the light of day
her delicate creation
meek loveliness is round thee spread
a softness still and holy
the grace of forest charms decay'd
and pastoral melancholy
rich groves of lofty stature
with yarrow winding through the pomp
of cultivated nature
and rising from those lofty groves
behold a ruin hoary
the shatter'd front of newark's towers
renown'd in border story
for sportive youth to stray in
for manhood to enjoy his strength
and age to wear away in
yon cottage seems a bower of bliss
a covert for protection
of studious ease and generous cares
and every chaste affection
the wild-wood fruits to gather
and on my true-love's forehead plant
a crest of blooming heather
and what if i enwreathed my own
'twere no offence to reason
the sober hills thus deck their brows
to meet the wintry season
loved yarrow have i won thee
a ray of fancy still survives--
her sunshine plays upon thee
thy ever-youthful waters keep
a course of lively pleasure
and gladsome notes my lips can breathe
accordant to the measure
they melt and soon must vanish
one hour is theirs nor more is mine--
sad thought which i would banish
but that i know where'er i go
thy genuine image yarrow
will dwell with me to heighten joy
and cheer my mind in sorrow
fairer far than this fair day
which like thee to those in sorrow
comes to bid a sweet good-morrow
to the rough year just awake
in its cradle on the brake
the brightest hour of unborn spring
through the winter wandering
found it seems the halcyon morn
to hoar february born
bending from heaven in azure mirth
it kiss'd the forehead of the earth
and smiled upon the silent sea
and bade the frozen streams be free
and waked to music all their fountains
and breathed upon the frozen mountains
and like a prophetess of may
strew'd flowers upon the barren way
making the wintry world appear
like one on whom thou smilest dear
to the wild wood and the downs--
to the silent wilderness
where the soul need not repress
its music lest it should not find
an echo in another's mind
while the touch of nature's art
harmonises heart to heart
awake arise and come away
to the wild woods and the plains
and the pools where winter rains
image all their roof of leaves
where the pine its garland weaves
of sapless green and ivy dun
round stems that never kiss the sun
where the lawns and pastures be
and the sandhills of the sea
where the melting hoar-frost wets
the daisy-star that never sets
and wind-flowers and violets
which yet join not scent to hue
crown the pale year weak and new
when the night is left behind
in the deep east dim and blind
and the blue noon is over us
and the multitudinous
billows murmur at our feet
where the earth and ocean meet
and all things seem only one
in the universal sun
all beautiful and bright as thou
the loveliest and the last is dead
rise memory and write its praise
up do thy wonted work come trace
the epitaph of glory fled
for now the earth has changed its face
a frown is on the heaven's brow
that skirts the ocean's foam
the lightest wind was in its nest
the tempest in its home
the whispering waves were half asleep
the clouds were gone to play
and on the bosom of the deep
the smile of heaven lay
it seem'd as if the hour were one
sent from beyond the skies
which scatter'd from above the sun
a light of paradise
the giants of the waste
tortured by storms to shapes as rude
as serpents interlaced --
and soothed by every azure breath
that under heaven is blown
to harmonies and hues beneath
as tender as its own
now all the tree-tops lay asleep
like green waves on the sea
as still as in the silent deep
the ocean-woods may be
by such a chain was bound
that even the busy woodpecker
made stiller by her sound
the inviolable quietness
the breath of peace we drew
with its soft motion made not less
the calm that round us grew
there seem'd from the remotest seat
of the wide mountain waste
to the soft flower beneath our feet
a magic circle traced
a spirit interfused around
a thrilling silent life
to momentary peace it bound
our mortal nature's strife --
and still i felt the centre of
the magic circle there
was one fair form that fill'd with love
the lifeless atmosphere
under the forest bough
each seemed as 'twere a little sky
gulf'd in a world below
a firmament of purple light
which in the dark earth lay
more boundless than the depth of night
and purer than the day--
in which the lovely forests grew
as in the upper air
more perfect both in shape and hue
than any spreading there
there lay the glade and neighbouring lawn
and through the dark green wood
the white sun twinkling like the dawn
out of a speckled cloud
sweet views which in our world above
can never well be seen
were imaged by the water's love
of that fair forest green
and all was interfused beneath
with an elysian glow
an atmosphere without a breath
a softer day below
like one beloved the scene had lent
to the dark water's breast
its very leaf and lineament
with more than truth exprest
until an envious wind crept by
like an unwelcome thought
which from the mind's too faithful eye
blots one dear image out
--though thou art ever fair and kind
the forests ever green
less oft is peace in shelley's mind
than calm in waters seen
the holy time is quiet as a nun
breathless with adoration the broad sun
is sinking down in its tranquillity
listen the mighty being is awake
and doth with his eternal motion make
a sound like thunder--everlastingly
if thou appear untouch'd by solemn thought
thy nature is not therefore less divine
and worshipp'st at the temple's inner shrine
god being with thee when we know it not
and sett'st the weary labourer free
if any star shed peace 'tis thou
that send'st it from above
appearing when heaven's breath and brow
are sweet as hers we love
whilst the landscape's odours rise
whilst far-off lowing herds are heard
and songs when toil is done
from cottages whose smoke unstirr'd
curls yellow in the sun
parted lovers on thee muse
their remembrancer in heaven
of thrilling vows thou art
too delicious to be riven
by absence from the heart
the wild birds hush their song
the hills have evening's deepest glow
yet leonard tarries long
now all whom varied toil and care
from home and love divide
in the calm sunset may repair
each to the loved one's side
who waits her gallant knight
looks to the western beam to spy
the flash of armour bright
the village maid with hand on brow
the level ray to shade
upon the footpath watches now
for colin's darkening plaid
by day they swam apart
and to the thicket wanders slow
the hind beside the hart
the woodlark at his partner's side
twitters his closing song--
all meet whom day and care divide
but leonard tarries long
of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth
wandering companionless
among the stars that have a different birth --
and ever-changing like a joyless eye
that finds no object worth its constancy
upon a wintry bough
the frozen wind crept on above
the freezing stream below
no flower upon the ground
and little motion in the air
except the mill-wheel's sound
one after one the sound of rain and bees
murmuring the fall of rivers winds and seas
smooth fields white sheets of water and pure sky --
sleepless and soon the small birds' melodies
must hear first utter'd from my orchard trees
and the first cuckoo's melancholy cry
and could not win thee sleep by any stealth
so do not let me wear to-night away
come bless d barrier between day and day
dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health
and the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky
and thousands had sunk on the ground overpower'd
the weary to sleep and the wounded to die
by the wolf-scaring faggot that guarded the slain
at the dead of the night a sweet vision i saw
and thrice ere the morning i dreamt it again
far far i had roam'd on a desolate track
'twas autumn --and sunshine arose on the way
to the home of my fathers that welcomed me back
in life's morning march when my bosom was young
i heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft
and knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung
from my home and my weeping friends never to part
my little ones kiss'd me a thousand times o'er
and my wife sobb'd aloud in her fulness of heart
and fain was their war-broken soldier to stay --
but sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn
and the voice in my dreaming ear melted away
bare winter suddenly was changed to spring
and gentle odours led my steps astray
mix'd with a sound of waters murmuring
along a shelving bank of turf which lay
under a copse and hardly dared to fling
its green arms round the bosom of the stream
but kiss'd it and then fled as thou mightest in dream
daisies those pearl'd arcturi of the earth
the constellated flower that never sets
faint oxlips tender blue-bells at whose birth
the sod scarce heaved and that tall flower that wets
its mother's face with heaven-collected tears
when the low wind its playmate's voice it hears
green cow-bind and the moonlight-colour'd may
and cherry-blossoms and white cups whose wine
was the bright dew yet drain'd not by the day
and wild roses and ivy serpentine
with its dark buds and leaves wandering astray
and flowers azure black and streak'd with gold
fairer than any waken'd eyes behold
there grew broad flag-flowers purple prankt with white
and starry river-buds among the sedge
and floating water-lilies broad and bright
which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
with moonlight beams of their own watery light
and bulrushes and reeds of such deep green
as soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen
i made a nosegay bound in such a way
that the same hues which in their natural bowers
were mingled or opposed the like array
kept these imprison'd children of the hours
within my hand --and then elate and gay
i hasten'd to the spot whence i had come
that i might there present it--o to whom
to pace the ground if path there be or none
while a fair region round the traveller lies
which he forbears again to look upon
the work of fancy or some happy tone
of meditation slipping in between
the beauty coming and the beauty gone
let us break off all commerce with the muse
with thought and love companions of our way--
the mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews
of inspiration on the humblest lay
pleasure never is at home
at a touch sweet pleasure melteth
like to bubbles when rain pelteth
then let wing d fancy wander
through the thought still spread beyond her
open wide the mind's cage-door
she'll dart forth and cloudward soar
o sweet fancy let her loose
summer's joys are spoilt by use
and the enjoying of the spring
fades as does its blossoming
autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too
blushing through the mist and dew
cloys with tasting what do then
sit thee by the ingle when
the sear faggot blazes bright
spirit of a winter's night
when the soundless earth is muffled
and the cak d snow is shuffled
from the ploughboy's heavy shoon
when the night doth meet the noon
in dark conspiracy
to banish even from her sky
--sit thee there and send abroad
with a mind self-overawed
fancy high-commission'd --send her
she has vassals to attend her
she will bring in spite of frost
beauties that the earth hath lost
she will bring thee all together
all delights of summer weather
all the buds and bells of may
from dewy sward or thorny spray
all the heap d autumn's wealth
with a still mysterious stealth
she will mix these pleasures up
like three fit wines in a cup
and thou shalt quaff it --thou shalt hear
distant harvest-carols clear
rustle of the reap d corn
sweet birds antheming the morn
and in the same moment--hark
'tis the early april lark
or the rooks with busy caw
foraging for sticks and straw
thou shalt at one glance behold
the daisy and the marigold
white-plumed lilies and the first
hedge-grown primrose that hath burst
shaded hyacinth alway
sapphire queen of the mid-may
and every leaf and every flower
pearl d with the self-same shower
thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
meagre from its cell d sleep
and the snake all winter-thin
cast on sunny bank its skin
freckled nest eggs thou shalt see
hatching in the hawthorn-tree
when the hen-bird's wing doth rest
quiet on her mossy nest
then the hurry and alarm
when the bee-hive casts its swarm
acorns ripe down-pattering
while the autumn breezes sing
everything is spoilt by use
where's the cheek that doth not fade
too much gazed at where's the maid
whose lip mature is ever new
where's the eye however blue
doth not weary where's the face
one would meet in every place
where's the voice however soft
one would hear so very oft
at a touch sweet pleasure melteth
like to bubbles when rain pelteth
let then wing d fancy find
thee a mistress to thy mind
dulcet-eyed as ceres' daughter
ere the god of torment taught her
how to frown and how to chide
with a waist and with a side
white as hebe's when her zone
slipt its golden clasp and down
fell her kirtle to her feet
while she held the goblet sweet
and jove grew languid --break the mesh
of the fancy's silken leash
quickly break her prison-string
and such joys as these she'll bring
--let the wing d fancy roam
pleasure never is at home
with their love the breath between them
and thy smiles before they dwindle
make the cold air fire then screen them
in those locks where whoso gazes
faints entangled in their mazes
through the veil which seems to hide them
as the radiant lines of morning
through thin clouds ere they divide them
and this atmosphere divinest
shrouds thee wheresoe'er thou shinest
but thy voice sounds low and tender
like the fairest for it folds thee
from the sight that liquid splendour
and all feel yet see thee never --
as i feel now lost for ever
its dim shapes are clad with brightness
and the souls of whom thou lovest
walk upon the winds with lightness
till they fail as i am failing
dizzy lost yet unbewailing
while in a grove i sat reclined
in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
bring sad thoughts to the mind
the human soul that through me ran
and much it grieved my heart to think
what man has made of man
the periwinkle trail'd its wreaths
and 'tis my faith that every flower
enjoys the air it breathes
their thoughts i cannot measure--
but the least motion which they made
it seem'd a thrill of pleasure
to catch the breezy air
and i must think do all i can
that there was pleasure there
if such be nature's holy plan
have i not reason to lament
what man has made of man
her father took another mate
and ruth not seven years old
a slighted child at her own will
went wandering over dale and hill
in thoughtless freedom bold
and music from that pipe could draw
like sounds of winds and floods
had built a bower upon the green
as if she from her birth had been
an infant of the woods
she seem'd to live her thoughts her own
herself her own delight
pleased with herself nor sad nor gay
she pass'd her time and in this way
grew up to woman's height
a military casque he wore
with splendid feathers drest
he brought them from the cherokees
the feathers nodded in the breeze
and made a gallant crest
but no he spake the english tongue
and bore a soldier's name
and when america was free
from battle and from jeopardy
he 'cross the ocean came
in finest tones the youth could speak
--while he was yet a boy
the moon the glory of the sun
and streams that murmur as they run
had been his dearest joy
the panther in the wilderness
was not so fair as he
and when he chose to sport and play
no dolphin ever was so gay
upon the tropic sea
and with him many tales he brought
of pleasure and of fear
such tales as told to any maid
by such a youth in the green shade
were perilous to hear
who quit their fold with dance and shout
their pleasant indian town
to gather strawberries all day long
returning with a choral song
when daylight is gone down
their blossoms through a boundless range
of intermingling hues
with budding fading faded flowers
they stand the wonder of the bowers
from morn to evening dews
high as a cloud high over head
the cypress and her spire
--of flowers that with one scarlet gleam
cover a hundred leagues and seem
to set the hills on fire
and many an endless endless lake
with all its fairy crowds
of islands that together lie
as quietly as spots of sky
among the evening clouds
a fisher or a hunter there
in sunshine or in shade
to wander with an easy mind
and build a household fire and find
a home in every glade
our life were life indeed with thee
so pass'd in quiet bliss
and all the while said he to know
that we were in a world of woe
on such an earth as this
fond thoughts about a father's love
for there said he are spun
around the heart such tender ties
that our own children to our eyes
are dearer than the sun
my helpmate in the woods to be
our shed at night to rear
or run my own adopted bride
a sylvan huntress at my side
and drive the flying deer
the wakeful ruth at midnight shed
a solitary tear
she thought again--and did agree
with him to sail across the sea
and drive the flying deer
we in the church our faith will plight
a husband and a wife
even so they did and i may say
that to sweet ruth that happy day
was more than human life
delighted all the while to think
that on those lonesome floods
and green savannahs she should share
his board with lawful joy and bear
his name in the wild woods
this stripling sportive gay and bold
and with his dancing crest
so beautiful through savage lands
had roam'd about with vagrant bands
of indians in the west
the tumult of a tropic sky
might well be dangerous food
for him a youth to whom was given
so much of earth--so much of heaven
and such impetuous blood
irregular in sight or sound
did to his mind impart
a kindred impulse seem'd allied
to his own powers and justified
the workings of his heart
the beauteous forms of nature wrought --
fair trees and gorgeous flowers
the breezes their own languor lent
the stars had feelings which they sent
into those favour'd bowers
that sometimes there did intervene
pure hopes of high intent
for passions link'd to forms so fair
and stately needs must have their share
of noble sentiment
with men to whom no better law
nor better life was known
deliberately and undeceived
those wild men's vices he received
and gave them back his own
were thus impair'd and he became
the slave of low desires
a man who without self-control
would seek what the degraded soul
unworthily admires
had woo'd the maiden day and night
had loved her night and morn
what could he less than love a maid
whose heart with so much nature play'd--
so kind and so forlorn
o ruth i have been worse than dead
false thoughts thoughts bold and vain
encompass'd me on every side
when i in confidence and pride
had cross'd the atlantic main
fresh as a banner bright unfurl'd
to music suddenly
i look'd upon those hills and plains
and seem'd as if let loose from chains
to live at liberty
dear ruth more happily set free
with nobler zeal i burn
my soul from darkness is released
like the whole sky when to the east
the morning doth return
no hope no wish remain'd not one --
they stirr'd him now no more
new objects did new pleasure give
and once again he wish'd to live
as lawless as before
they for the voyage were prepared
and went to the sea-shore
but when they thither came the youth
deserted his poor bride and ruth
could never find him more
that she in half a year was mad
and in a prison housed
and there exulting in her wrongs
among the music of her songs
she fearfully caroused
nor wanted sun nor rain nor dew
nor pastimes of the may
--they all were with her in her cell
and a clear brook with cheerful knell
did o'er the pebbles play
there came a respite to her pain
she from her prison fled
but of the vagrant none took thought
and where it liked her best she sought
her shelter and her bread
the master-current of her brain
ran permanent and free
and coming to the banks of tone
there did she rest and dwell alone
under the greenwood tree
that shaped her sorrow rocks and pools
and airs that gently stir
the vernal leaves--she loved them still
nor ever tax'd them with the ill
which had been done to her
but till the warmth of summer skies
and summer days is gone
and all do in this tale agree
she sleeps beneath the greenwood tree
and other home hath none
and ruth will long before her day
be broken down and old
sore aches she needs must have but less
of mind than body's wretchedness
from damp and rain and cold
she from her dwelling in the wood
repairs to a road-side
and there she begs at one steep place
where up and down with easy pace
the horsemen-travellers ride
or thrown away but with a flute
her loneliness she cheers
this flute made of a hemlock stalk
at evening in his homeward walk
the quantock woodman hears
setting her little water-mills
by spouts and fountains wild--
such small machinery as she turn'd
ere she had wept ere she had mourn'd
a young and happy child
ill-fated ruth in hallow'd mould
thy corpse shall buried be
for thee a funeral bell shall ring
and all the congregation sing
a christian psalm for thee
in the deep wide sea of misery
or the mariner worn and wan
never thus could voyage on
day and night and night and day
drifting on his dreary way
with the solid darkness black
closing round his vessel's track
whilst above the sunless sky
big with clouds hangs heavily
and behind the tempest fleet
hurries on with lightning feet
riving sail and cord and plank
till the ship has almost drank
death from the o'er-brimming deep
and sinks down down like that sleep
when the dreamer seems to be
weltering through eternity
and the dim low line before
of a dark and distant shore
still recedes as ever still
longing with divided will
but no power to seek or shun
he is ever drifted on
o'er the unreposing wave
to the haven of the grave
in the waters of wide agony
to such a one this morn was led
my bark by soft winds piloted
--'mid the mountains euganean
i stood listening to the paean
with which the legion'd rooks did hail
the sun's uprise majestical
gathering round with wings all hoar
through the dewy mist they soar
like gray shades till the eastern heaven
bursts and then --as clouds of even
fleck'd with fire and azure lie
in the unfathomable sky --
so their plumes of purple grain
starr'd with drops of golden rain
gleam above the sunlight woods
as in silent multitudes
on the morning's fitful gale
through the broken mist they sail
and the vapours cloven and gleaming
follow down the dark steep streaming
till all is bright and clear and still
round the solitary hill
the waveless plain of lombardy
bounded by the vaporous air
islanded by cities fair
underneath day's azure eyes
ocean's nursling venice lies --
a peopled labyrinth of walls
amphitrite's destined halls
which her hoary sire now paves
with his blue and beaming waves
lo the sun upsprings behind
broad red radiant half-reclined
on the level quivering line
of the waters crystalline
and before that chasm of light
as within a furnace bright
column tower and dome and spire
shine like obelisks of fire
pointing with inconstant motion
from the altar of dark ocean
to the sapphire-tinted skies
as the flames of sacrifice
from the marble shrines did rise
as to pierce the dome of gold
where apollo spoke of old
ocean's child and then his queen
now is come a darker day
and thou soon must be his prey
if the power that raised thee here
hallow so thy watery bier
a less drear ruin then than now
with thy conquest-branded brow
stooping to the slave of slaves
from thy throne among the waves
wilt thou be --when the sea-mew
flies as once before it flew
o'er thine isles depopulate
and all is in its ancient state
save where many a palace-gate
with green sea-flowers overgrown
like a rock of ocean's own
topples o'er the abandon'd sea
as the tides change sullenly
the fisher on his watery way
wandering at the close of day
will spread his sail and seize his oar
till he pass the gloomy shore
lest thy dead should from their sleep
bursting o'er the starlight deep
lead a rapid masque of death
o'er the waters of his path
'tis the noon of autumn's glow
when a soft and purple mist
like a vaporous amethyst
or an air-dissolv d star
mingling light and fragrance far
from the curved horizon's bound
to the point of heaven's profound
fills the overflowing sky
and the plains that silent lie
underneath the leaves unsodden
where the infant frost has trodden
with his morning-wing d feet
whose bright print is gleaming yet
and the red and golden vines
piercing with their trellised lines
the rough dark-skirted wilderness
the dun and bladed grass no less
pointing from this hoary tower
in the windless air the flower
glimmering at my feet the line
of the olive-sandall'd apennine
in the south dimly islanded
and the alps whose snows are spread
high between the clouds and sun
and of living things each one
and my spirit which so long
darken'd this swift stream of song --
interpenetrated lie
by the glory of the sky
be it love light harmony
odour or the soul of all
which from heaven like dew doth fall
or the mind which feeds this verse
peopling the lone universe
autumn's evening meets me soon
leading the infantine moon
and that one star which to her
almost seems to minister
half the crimson light she brings
from the sunset's radiant springs
and the soft dreams of the morn
which like wing d winds had borne
to that silent isle which lies
'mid remember'd agonies
the frail bark of this lone being
pass to other sufferers fleeing
and its ancient pilot pain
sits beside the helm again
in the sea of life and agony
other spirits float and flee
o'er that gulf ev'n now perhaps
on some rock the wild wave wraps
with folding wings they waiting sit
for my bark to pilot it
to some calm and blooming cove
where for me and those i love
may a windless bower be built
far from passion pain and guilt
in a dell 'mid lawny hills
which the wild sea-murmur fills
and soft sunshine and the sound
of old forests echoing round
and the light and smell divine
of all flowers that breathe and shine
--we may live so happy there
that the spirits of the air
envying us may even entice
to our healing paradise
the polluting multitude
but their rage would be subdued
by that clime divine and calm
and the winds whose wings rain balm
on the uplifted soul and leaves
under which the bright sea heaves
while each breathless interval
in their whisperings musical
the inspired soul supplies
with its own deep melodies
and the love which heals all strife
circling like the breath of life
all things in that sweet abode
with its own mild brotherhood
they not it would change and soon
every sprite beneath the moon
would repent its envy vain
and the earth grow young again
thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing
yellow and black and pale and hectic red
pestilence-stricken multitudes o thou
who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
the wing d seeds where they lie cold and low
each like a corpse within its grave until
thine azure sister of the spring shall blow
her clarion o'er the dreaming earth and fill
driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air
with living hues and odours plain and hill
wild spirit which art moving everywhere
destroyer and preserver hear o hear
loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed
shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean
angels of rain and lightning there are spread
on the blue surface of thine airy surge
like the bright hair uplifted from the head
of some fierce maenad ev'n from the dim verge
of the horizon to the zenith's height--
the locks of the approaching storm thou dirge
of the dying year to which this closing night
will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
vaulted with all thy congregated might
of vapours from whose solid atmosphere
black rain and fire and hail will burst o hear
the blue mediterranean where he lay
lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams
beside a pumice isle in baiae's bay
and saw in sleep old palaces and towers
quivering within the wave's intenser day
all overgrown with azure moss and flowers
so sweet the sense faints picturing them thou
for whose path the atlantic's level powers
cleave themselves into chasms while far below
the sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
the sapless foliage of the ocean know
thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear
and tremble and despoil themselves o hear
if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee
a wave to pant beneath thy power and share
the impulse of thy strength only less free
than thou o uncontrollable if even
i were as in my boyhood and could be
the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven
as then when to outstrip the skyey speed
scarce seem'd a vision i would ne'er have striven
as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need
o lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud
i fall upon the thorns of life i bleed
a heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd
one too like thee tameless and swift and proud
what if my leaves are falling like its own
the tumult of thy mighty harmonies
will take from both a deep autumnal tone
sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce
my spirit be thou me impetuous one
drive my dead thoughts over the universe
like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth
and by the incantation of this verse
scatter as from an unextinguish'd hearth
ashes and sparks my words among mankind
be through my lips to unawaken'd earth
the trumpet of a prophecy o wind
if winter comes can spring be far behind
sir george beaumont
four summer weeks i dwelt in sight of thee
i saw thee every day and all the while
thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea
so like so very like was day to day
whene'er i look'd thy image still was there
it trembled but it never pass'd away
no mood which season takes away or brings
i could have fancied that the mighty deep
was even the gentlest of all gentle things
to express what then i saw and add the gleam
the light that never was on sea or land
the consecration and the poet's dream --
amid a world how different from this
beside a sea that could not cease to smile
on tranquil land beneath a sky of bliss
elysian quiet without toil or strife
no motion but the moving tide a breeze
or merely silent nature's breathing life
such picture would i at that time have made
and seen the soul of truth in every part
a steadfast peace that might not be betray'd
i have submitted to a new control
a power is gone which nothing can restore
a deep distress hath humanised my soul
a smiling sea and be what i have been
the feeling of my loss will ne'er be old
this which i know i speak with mind serene
if he had lived of him whom i deplore
this work of thine i blame not but commend
this sea in anger and that dismal shore
well chosen is the spirit that is here
that hulk which labours in the deadly swell
this rueful sky this pageantry of fear
i love to see the look with which it braves
--cased in the unfeeling armour of old time--
the lightning the fierce wind and trampling waves
housed in a dream at distance from the kind
such happiness wherever it be known
is to be pitied for 'tis surely blind
and frequent sights of what is to be borne
such sights or worse as are before me here
not without hope we suffer and we mourn
dreaming like a love-adept
in the sound his breathing kept
nor seeks nor finds he mortal blisses
but feeds on the aerial kisses
of shapes that haunt thought's wildernesses
he will watch from dawn to gloom
the lake-reflected sun illume
the yellow bees in the ivy-bloom
nor heed nor see what things they be--
but from these create he can
forms more real than living man
nurslings of immortality
getting and spending we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away a sordid boon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up-gather'd now like sleeping flowers
for this for everything we are out of tune
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn --
so might i standing on this pleasant lea
have sight of proteus rising from the sea
or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn
with ill-match'd aims the architect who plann'd
albeit labouring for a scanty band
of white-robed scholars only this immense
--give all thou canst high heaven rejects the lore
of nicely-calculated less or more --
so deem'd the man who fashion'd for the sense
self-poised and scoop'd into ten thousand cells
where light and shade repose where music dwells
like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
that they were born for immortality
where hope clung feeding like a bee--
both were mine life went a-maying
with nature hope and poesy
when i was young
ah for the change 'twixt now and then
this breathing house not built with hands
this body that does me grievous wrong
o'er aery cliffs and glittering sands
how lightly then it flash'd along
like those trim skiffs unknown of yore
on winding lakes and rivers wide
that ask no aid of sail or oar
that fear no spite of wind or tide
nought cared this body for wind or weather
when youth and i lived in't together
flowers are lovely love is flower-like
friendship is a sheltering tree
o the joys that came down shower-like
of friendship love and liberty
ere i was old
which tells me youth's no longer here
o youth for years so many and sweet
'tis known that thou and i were one
i'll think it but a fond conceit--
it cannot be that thou art gone
thy vesper-bell hath not yet toll'd --
and thou wert aye a masker bold
what strange disguise hast now put on
to make believe that thou art gone
i see these locks in silvery slips
this drooping gait this alter'd size
but springtide blossoms on thy lips
and tears take sunshine from thine eyes
life is but thought so think i will
that youth and i are housemates still
but the tears of mournful eve
where no hope is life's a warning
that only serves to make us grieve
--that only serves to make us grieve
with oft and tedious taking-leave
like some poor nigh-related guest
that may not rudely be dismist
yet hath out-stay'd his welcome while
and tells the jest without a smile
uprose the morning sun
and matthew stopp'd he looked and said
the will of god be done
with hair of glittering gray
as blithe a man as you could see
on a spring holiday
and by the steaming rills
we travel'd merrily to pass
a day among the hills
then from thy breast what thought
beneath so beautiful a sun
so sad a sigh has brought
and fixing still his eye
upon the eastern mountain-top
to me he made reply
brings fresh into my mind
a day like this which i have left
full thirty years behind
such colours and no other
were in the sky that april morn
of this the very brother
which that sweet season gave
and to the church-yard come stopp'd short
beside my daughter's grave
the pride of all the vale
and then she sang --she would have been
a very nightingale
and yet i loved her more--
for so it seem'd --than till that day
i e'er had loved before
beside the church-yard yew
a blooming girl whose hair was wet
with points of morning dew
her brow was smooth and white
to see a child so very fair
it was a pure delight
e'er tripped with foot so free
she seem'd as happy as a wave
that dances on the sea
which i could ill confine
i looked at her and looked again
and did not wish her mine
methinks i see him stand
as at that moment with a bough
of wilding in his hand
affectionate and true
a pair of friends though i was young
and matthew seventy-two
beside a mossy seat
and from the turf a fountain broke
and gurgled at our feet
this water's pleasant tune
with some old border song or catch
that suits a summer's noon
sing here beneath the shade
that half-mad thing of witty rhymes
which you last april made
the spring beneath the tree
and thus the dear old man replied
the gray-hair'd man of glee
how merrily it goes
'twill murmur on a thousand years
and flow as now it flows
i cannot choose but think
how oft a vigorous man i lay
beside this fountain's brink
my heart is idly stirr'd
for the same sound is in my ears
which in those days i heard
and yet the wiser mind
mourns less for what age takes away
than what it leaves behind
the lark above the hill
let loose their carols when they please
are quiet when they will
a foolish strife they see
a happy youth and their old age
is beautiful and free
and often glad no more
we wear a face of joy because
we have been glad of yore
his kindred laid in earth
the household hearts that were his own --
it is the man of mirth
my life has been approved
and many love me but by none
am i enough beloved
the man who thus complains
i live and sing my idle songs
upon these happy plains
i'll be a son to thee
at this he grasp'd my hand and said
alas that cannot be
and down the smooth descent
of the green sheep-track did we glide
and through the wood we went
he sang those witty rhymes
about the crazy old church-clock
and the bewilder'd chimes
our life's succeeding stages
a day to childhood seems a year
and years like passing ages
ere passion yet disorders
steals lingering like a river smooth
along its grassy borders
and sorrow's shafts fly thicker
ye stars that measure life to man
why seem your courses quicker
and life itself is vapid
why as we reach the falls of death
feel we its tide more rapid
time's course to lower speeding
when one by one our friends have gone
and left our bosoms bleeding
indemnifying fleetness
and those of youth a seeming length
proportion'd to their sweetness
there are four seasons in the mind of man
he has his lusty spring when fancy clear
takes in all beauty with an easy span
spring's honey'd cud of youthful thought he loves
to ruminate and by such dreaming high
is nearest unto heaven quiet coves
he furleth close contented so to look
on mists in idleness--to let fair things
pass by unheeded as a threshold brook --
or else he would forego his mortal nature
on whose last steps i climb
trembling at that where i had stood before
when will return the glory of your prime
no more--o never more
a joy has taken flight
fresh spring and summer and winter hoar
move my faint heart with grief but with delight
no more--o never more
a rainbow in the sky
so was it when my life began
so is it now i am a man
so be it when i shall grow old
or let me die
the child is father of the man
i could wish my days to be
bound each to each by natural piety
the earth and every common sight
to me did seem
apparell'd in celestial light
the glory and the freshness of a dream
it is not now as it hath been of yore --
turn wheresoe'er i may
by night or day
the things which i have seen i now can see no more
and lovely is the rose
the moon doth with delight
look round her when the heavens are bare
waters on a starry night
are beautiful and fair
the sunshine is a glorious birth
but yet i know where'er i go
that there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth
and while the young lambs bound
as to the tabor's sound
to me alone there came a thought of grief
a timely utterance gave that thought relief
and i again am strong
the cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep --
no more shall grief of mine the season wrong
i hear the echoes through the mountains throng
the winds come to me from the fields of sleep
and all the earth is gay
land and sea
give themselves up to jollity
and with the heart of may
doth every beast keep holiday --
thou child of joy
shout round me let me hear thy shouts thou happy
shepherd boy
ye to each other make i see
the heavens laugh with you in your jubilee
my heart is at your festival
my head hath its coronal
the fulness of your bliss i feel--i feel it all
o evil day if i were sullen
while earth herself is adorning
this sweet may morning
and the children are pulling
on every side
in a thousand valleys far and wide
fresh flowers while the sun shines warm
and the babe leaps up on his mother's arm --
i hear i hear with joy i hear
--but there's a tree of many one
a single field which i have look'd upon
both of them speak of something that is gone
the pansy at my feet
doth the same tale repeat
whither is fled the visionary gleam
where is it now the glory and the dream
the soul that rises with us our life's star
hath had elsewhere its setting
and cometh from afar
not in entire forgetfulness
and not in utter nakedness
but trailing clouds of glory do we come
from god who is our home
heaven lies about us in our infancy
shades of the prison-house begin to close
upon the growing boy
but he beholds the light and whence it flows
he sees it in his joy
the youth who daily farther from the east
must travel still is nature's priest
and by the vision splendid
is on his way attended
at length the man perceives it die away
and fade into the light of common day
yearnings she hath in her own natural kind
and even with something of a mother's mind
and no unworthy aim
the homely nurse doth all she can
to make her foster-child her inmate man
forget the glories he hath known
and that imperial palace whence he came
a six years' darling of a pigmy size
see where 'mid work of his own hand he lies
fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses
with light upon him from his father's eyes
see at his feet some little plan or chart
some fragment from his dream of human life
shaped by himself with newly-learn d art
a wedding or a festival
a mourning or a funeral
and this hath now his heart
and unto this he frames his song
then will he fit his tongue
to dialogues of business love or strife
but it will not be long
ere this be thrown aside
and with new joy and pride
the little actor cons another part
filling from time to time his humorous stage
with all the persons down to palsied age
that life brings with her in her equipage
as if his whole vocation
were endless imitation
thy soul's immensity
thou best philosopher who yet dost keep
thy heritage thou eye among the blind
that deaf and silent read'st the eternal deep
haunted for ever by the eternal mind --
mighty prophet seer blest
on whom those truths do rest
which we are toiling all our lives to find
in darkness lost the darkness of the grave
thou over whom thy immortality
broods like the day a master o'er a slave
a presence which is not to be put by
thou little child yet glorious in the might
of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height
why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
the years to bring the inevitable yoke
thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife
full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight
and custom lie upon thee with a weight
heavy as frost and deep almost as life
is something that doth live
that nature yet remembers
what was so fugitive
the thought of our past years in me doth breed
perpetual benediction not indeed
for that which is most worthy to be blest
delight and liberty the simple creed
of childhood whether busy or at rest
with new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast
--not for these i raise
the song of thanks and praise
but for those obstinate questionings
of sense and outward things
fallings from us vanishings
blank misgivings of a creature
moving about in worlds not realised
high instincts before which our mortal nature
did tremble like a guilty thing surprised
but for those first affections
those shadowy recollections
which be they what they may
are yet the fountain-light of all our day
are yet a master-light of all our seeing
uphold us--cherish--and have power to make
our noisy years seem moments in the being
of the eternal silence truths that wake
to perish never
which neither listlessness nor mad endeavour
nor man nor boy
nor all that is at enmity with joy
can utterly abolish or destroy
hence in a season of calm weather
though inland far we be
our souls have sight of that immortal sea
which brought us hither
can in a moment travel thither--
and see the children sport upon the shore
and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore
and let the young lambs bound
as to the tabor's sound
we in thought will join your throng
ye that pipe and ye that play
ye that through your hearts to-day
feel the gladness of the may
what though the radiance which was once so bright
be now for ever taken from my sight
though nothing can bring back the hour
of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower
we will grieve not rather find
strength in what remains behind
in the primal sympathy
which having been must ever be
in the soothing thoughts that spring
out of human suffering
in the faith that looks through death
in years that bring the philosophic mind
forebode not any severing of our loves
yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might
i only have relinquish'd one delight
to live beneath your more habitual sway
i love the brooks which down their channels fret
even more than when i tripp'd lightly as they
the innocent brightness of a new-born day
is lovely yet
the clouds that gather round the setting sun
do take a sober colouring from an eye
that hath kept watch o'er man's mortality
another race hath been and other palms are won
thanks to the human heart by which we live
thanks to its tenderness its joys and fears
to me the meanest flower that blows can give
thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears
vibrates in the memory--
odours when sweet violets sicken
live within the sense they quicken
are heap'd for the beloved's bed
and so thy thoughts when thou art gone
love itself shall slumber on

finely of shakespeare shakespeare could not have written an epic he
would have died of plethora of thought this prodigality of nature is
exemplified equally in his sonnets the copious selection here given
which from the wealth of the material required greater consideration
than any other portion of the editor's task contains many that will not
be fully felt and understood without some earnestness of thought on the
reader's part but he is not likely to regret the labour
of contempt

sensitiveness to passion --hence the attraction he felt in the

duke of savoy this collect in verse as it has been justly named is
the most mighty sonnet in any language known to the editor readers
should observe that unlike our sonnets of the sixteenth century it is
constructed on the original italian or proven al model --unquestionably
far superior to the imperfect form employed by shakespeare and drummond
strictly fulfilled of his deference to the parliament in stanzas
milton's style than has been reached by any other poet is occasionally
obscure from imitation of the condensed latin syntax the meaning of st
is rivalry or hostility are the same to a lofty spirit and
limitation more hateful than opposition the allusion in st is to

original title of this sonnet milton was then living in aldersgate

citizens massacred by thousands alexander ordered the house of pindar
to be spared he was as incapable of appreciating the poet as lewis xiv
of appreciating racine but even the narrow and barbarian mind of
alexander could understand the advantage of a showy act of homage to
poetry
stories he says that when the spartan confederacy in b c took
athens a proposal to demolish it was rejected through the effect
produced on the commanders by hearing part of a chorus from the electra
of euripides sung at a feast there is however no apparent congruity
between the lines quoted ed dindorf and the result ascribed to
them
of the pure simonides

to the bench

arcadia or to sidney himself as a model of gentleness in spirit and
demeanour
hanover these lines are a fine specimen of gallant and courtly
compliment
who died march - coincidently with the dissolution of the third
parliament of charles's reign hence milton poetically compares his
death to that of the orator isocrates of athens after philip's victory

poems appear due to the seventeenth century and have therefore been
placed in book ii
wonderful verses which like lycidas may be regarded as a test of
any reader's insight into the most poetical aspects of poetry the
general differences between them are vast but in imaginative intensity
marvell and shelley are closely related this poem is printed as a
translation in marvell's works but the original latin is obviously his
own the most striking verses in it here quoted as the book is rare
answer more or less to stanzas and
per templa per urbes quaesivi regum perque alta palatia frustra sed
vos hortorum per opaca silentia longe celarunt plantae virides et
concolor umbra
astonishing power that these the earliest pure descriptive lyrics in
our language should still remain the best in a style which so many
great poets have since attempted the bright and the thoughtful aspects
of nature are their subjects but each is preceded by a mythological
introduction in a mixed classical and italian manner the meaning of the
first is that gaiety is the child of nature of the second that
pensiveness is the daughter of sorrow and genius
read erebus who in the mythology is brother at once and husband of
night but the issue of this union is not sadness but day and
aether --completing the circle of primary creation as the parents are
both children of chaos the first-begotten of all things hesiod

records cowper's gratitude to the lady whose affectionate care for many
years gave what sweetness he could enjoy to a life radically wretched
petrarch's sonnets have a more ethereal grace and a more perfect finish
shakespeare's more passion milton's stand supreme in stateliness
wordsworth's in depth and delicacy but cowper's unites with an
exquisiteness in the turn of thought which the ancients would have
called irony an intensity of pathetic tenderness peculiar to his loving
and ingenuous nature there is much mannerism much that is unimportant
or of now exhausted interest in his poems but where he is great it is
with that elementary greatness which rests on the most universal human
feelings cowper is our highest master in simple pathos
of this truly noble poem it should be noted as exhibiting a rare
excellence --the climax of simple sublimity
qualities which give first-rate poetical rank to lyrics such as
to-morrow or sally in our alley when compared with poems written
if the phrase may be allowed in keys so different as the subtle
sweetness of shelley the grandeur of gray and milton or the delightful
pastoralism of the elizabethan verse intelligent readers will gain
hence a clear understanding of the vast imaginative range of
poetry --through what wide oscillations the mind and the taste of a
nation may pass --how many are the roads which truth and nature open to
excellence
that to find in chapman's homer the pure serene of the original the
reader must bring with him the imagination of the youthful poet --he
must be a greek himself as shelley finely said of keats
employs proper names nor is there a surer sign of high poetical genius
the change of a title that the aim of the verses following may be
grasped more clearly and immediately
beautiful sonnet was the last word of a poet deserving the title
marvellous boy in a much higher sense than chatterton if the
fulfilment may ever safely be prophesied from the promise england
appears to have lost in keats one whose gifts in poetry have rarely been
surpassed shakespeare milton and wordsworth had their lives been
closed at twenty-five would so far as we know have left poems of less
excellence and hope than the youth who from the petty school and the
london surgery passed at once to a place with them of high collateral
glory
sweet and genuinely national style
reasoning in verse --as the next is equally characteristic of shelley's
wayward intensity and of the dramatic power the vital
identification of the poet with other times and characters in which
scott is second only to shakespeare
the lake of geneva for his courageous defence of his country against the
tyranny with which piedmont threatened it during the first half of the
seventeenth century this noble sonnet is worthy to stand near milton's

hohen linden means high limetrees

choice spirits of that age
this little song which unites simplicity and dramatic power to a
wild-wood music of the rarest quality no moral is drawn far less any
conscious analysis of feeling attempted --the pathetic meaning is left
to be suggested by the mere presentiment of the situation inexperienced
critics have often named this which may be called the homeric manner
superficial from its apparent simple facility but first-rate
excellence in it as shown here in and is in truth one
of the least common triumphs of poetry --this style should be compared
with what is not less perfect in its way the searching out of inner
feeling the expression of hidden meanings the revelation of the heart
of nature and of the soul within the soul --the analytical method in
short --most completely represented by wordsworth and by shelley
ingenious but of all poetical qualities ingenuity is least in
accordance with pathos
expression which place it in the highest rank amongst the many
masterpieces of its illustrious author

subject better treated in and
subtle sweetness a good poet might have written and roses
wild --yet this slight change would disenchant the verse of its peculiar
beauty

to the worship of nature
italy is expressed with an obscurity not unfrequent with its author it
appears to be --on the voyage of life are many moments of pleasure
given by the sight of nature who has power to heal even the worldliness
and the uncharity of man
is seagirt many of shelley's poems appear to have been printed in
england during his residence abroad others were printed from his
manuscripts after his death hence probably the text of no english poet
after contains so many errors see the note on no
mythology
of the laud and hence with the winds which affect them
john this poem should be compared with shelley's following it each is
the most complete expression of the innermost spirit of his art given by
these great poets --of that idea which as in the case of the true
painter to quote the words of reynolds subsists only in the mind
the sight never beheld it nor has the hand expressed it it is an idea
residing in the breast of the artist which he is always labouring to
impart and which he dies at last without imparting

ah chloris could i now but sit
ah county guy the hour is nigh
all in the downs the fleet was moor'd
all thoughts all passions all delights
and are ye sure the news is true
and is this yarrow --this the stream
and thou art dead as young and fair
and wilt thou leave me thus
ariel to miranda --take
art thou pale for weariness
art thou poor yet hast thou golden slumbers
as it fell upon a day
as i was walking all alane
a slumber did my spirit seal
as slow our ship her foamy track
a sweet disorder in the dress
at the corner of wood street when daylight appears
at the mid hour of night when stars are weeping i fly
avenge o lord thy slaughter'd saints whose bones
awake aeolian lyre awake
awake awake my lyre
a weary lot is thine fair maid
a wet sheet and a flowing sea
a widow bird sate mourning for her love
beauty sat bathing by a spring
behold her single in the field
being your slave what should i do but tend
beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed
best and brightest come away
bid me to live and i will live
blest pair of sirens pledges of heaven's joy
blow blow thou winter wind
bright star would i were steadfast as thou art
calm was the day and through the trembling air
captain or colonel or knight in arms
care-charmer sleep son of the sable night
come away come away death
come live with me and be my love
crabbed age and youth
cupid and my campaspe play'd
cyriack whose grandsire on the royal bench
daughter to that good earl once president
degenerate douglas o the unworthy lord
diaphenia like the daffadowndilly
doth then the world go thus doth all thus move
down in yon garden sweet and gay
drink to me only with thine eyes
duncan gray cam here to woo
earth has not anything to show more fair
eternal spirit of the chainless mind
ethereal minstrel pilgrim of the sky
ever let the fancy roam
fair pledges of a fruitful tree
farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
fear no more the heat o' the sun
for ever fortune wilt thou prove
forget not yet the tried intent
four seasons fill the measure of the year
from harmony from heavenly harmony
from stirling castle we had seen
full fathom five thy father lies
gem of the crimson-colour'd even
go fetch to me a pint o' wine
go lovely rose
happy the man whose wish and care
happy those early days when i
he is gone on the mountain
he that loves a rosy cheek
hence all you vain delights
hence loath d melancholy
hence vain deluding joys
how delicious is the winning
how happy is he born and taught
how like a winter hath my absence been
how sleep the brave who sink to rest
how sweet the answer echo makes
how vainly men themselves amaze
i arise from dreams of thee
i dream'd that as i wander'd by the way
if aught of oaten stop or pastoral song
if doughty deeds my lady please
i fear thy kisses gentle maiden
if thou survive my well-contented day
if to be absent were to be
if women could be fair and yet not fond
i have had playmates i have had companions
i heard a thousand blended notes
i met a traveller from an antique land
i'm wearing awa' jean
in a drear-nighted december
in the downhill of life when i find i'm declining
in the sweet shire of cardigan
i remember i remember
i saw where in the shroud did lurk
it is a beauteous evening calm and free
it is not beauty i demand
it is not growing like a tree
i travell'd among unknown men
it was a lover and his lass
it was a summer evening
i've heard them lilting at our ewe-milking
i wander'd lonely as a cloud
i was thy neighbour once thou rugged pile
i wish i were where helen lies
let me not to the marriage of true minds
life i know not what thou art
life of life thy lips enkindle
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
like to the clear in highest sphere
love not me for comely grace
lo where the rosy-bosom'd hours
mary i want a lyre with other strings
milton thou shouldst be living at this hour
mine be a cot beside the hill
mortality behold and fear
most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes
much have i travell'd in the realms of gold
music when soft voices die
my days among the dead are past
my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains
my heart leaps up when i behold
my love in her attire doth show her wit
my lute be as thou wert when thou didst grow
my thoughts hold mortal strife
my true-love hath my heart and i have his
not a drum was heard not a funeral note
not celia that i juster am
now the golden morn aloft
now the last day of many days
o brignall banks are wild and fair
of all the girls that are so smart
of a' the airts the wind can blaw
of nelson and the north
o friend i know not which way i must look
of this fair volume which we world do name
oft in the stilly night
o if thou knew'st how thou thyself dost harm
oh lovers' eyes are sharp to see
oh snatch'd away in beauty's bloom
o listen listen ladies gay
o mary at thy window be
o me what eyes hath love put in my head
o mistress mine where are you roaming
o my luve's like a red red rose
on a day alack the day
on a poet's lips i slept
once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
one more unfortunate
one word is too often profaned
o never say that i was false of heart
on linden when the sun was low
o saw ye bonnie lesley
o say what is that thing call'd light
o talk not to me of a name great in story
our bugles sang truce for the night-cloud had lower'd
over the mountains
o waly waly up the bank
o what can ail thee knight-at-arms
o wild west wind thou breath of autumn's being
o world o life o time
phoebus arise
pibroch of donuil dhu
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
proud maisie is in the wood
ruin seize thee ruthless king
shall i compare thee to a summer's day
shall i wasting in despair
she dwelt among the untrodden ways
she is not fair to outward view
she walks in beauty like the night
she was a phantom of delight
since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
since there's no help come let us kiss and part
sleep on and dream of heaven awhile
souls of poets dead and gone
spring the sweet spring is the year's pleasant king
star that bringest home the bee
stern daughter of the voice of god
surprised by joy--impatient as the wind
sweet be not proud of those two eyes
sweet highland girl a very shower
sweet stream that winds through yonder glade
swiftly walk over the western wave
tax not the royal saint with vain expense
tell me not sweet i am unkind
tell me where is fancy bred
that time of year thou may'st in me behold
that which her slender waist confined
the curfew tolls the knell of parting day
the forward youth that would appear
the fountains mingle with the river
the glories of our blood and state
the last and greatest herald of heaven's king
the lovely lass o' inverness
the merchant to secure his treasure
the more we live more brief appear
the poplars are fell'd farewell to the shade
the sun is warm the sky is clear
the sun upon the lake is low
the twentieth year is well-nigh past
the world is too much with us late and soon
the world's a bubble and the life of man
there be none of beauty's daughters
there is a flower the lesser celandine
there is a garden in her face
there's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
there was a time when meadow grove and stream
they that have power to hurt and will do none
this is the month and this the happy morn
this life which seems so fair
three years she grew in sun and shower
thy braes were bonnie yarrow stream
thy hue dear pledge is pure and bright
timely blossom infant fair
tired with all these for restful death i cry
toll for the brave
to me fair friend you never can be old
'twas at the royal feast for persia won
'twas on a lofty vase's side
two voices are there one is of the sea
victorious men of earth no more
wee sleekit cow'rin' tim'rous beastie
were i as base as is the lowly plain
we talk'd with open heart and tongue
we walk'd along while bright and red
we watch'd her breathing thro' the night
whenas in silks my julia goes
when britain first at heaven's command
when first the fiery-mantled sun
when god at first made man
when he who adores thee has left but the name
when icicles hang by the wall
when i consider how my light is spent
when i have borne in memory what has tamed
when i have fears that i may cease to be
when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
when in the chronicle of wasted time
when lovely woman stoops to folly
when love with unconfined wings
when maidens such as hester die
when music heavenly maid was young
when ruth was left half desolate
when the lamp is shatter'd
when the sheep are in the fauld and the kye at hame
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
when we two parted
where art thou my beloved son
where shall the lover rest
where the remote bermudas ride
while that the sun with his beams hot
whoe'er she be
why art thou silent is thy love a plant
why damon with the forward day
why so pale and wan fond lover
why weep ye by the tide ladie
with little here to do or see
ye banks and braes o' bonnie doon
ye distant spires ye antique towers
ye mariners of england
yes there is holy pleasure in thine eye
yet once more o ye laurels and once more
you meaner beauties of the night

the wild honeysuckle
hid in this silent dull retreat
untouched thy honey'd blossoms blow
unseen thy little branches greet
no roving foot shall crush thee here
no busy hand provoke a tear
she bade thee shun the vulgar eye
and planted here the guardian shade
and sent soft waters murmuring by
thus quietly thy summer goes --
thy days declining to repose
i grieve to see your future doom
they died--nor were those flowers more gay--
the flowers that did in eden bloom
unpitying frosts and autumn's power
shall leave no vestige of this flower
at first thy little being came
if nothing once you nothing lose
for when you die you are the same
the space between is but an hour
the frail duration of a flower
to tinge thy lips with coral hue
who from india's distant wave
for thee those pearly treasures drew
who from yonder orient sky
stole the morning of thine eye
from sea and earth and air are torn
roses bloom upon thy cheek
on thy breath their fragrance borne
guard thy bosom from the day
lest thy snows should melt away
which mute earth can ne'er impart
nor in ocean wilt thou find
nor in the circling air a heart
fairest wouldst thou perfect be
take oh take that heart from me
that opens to the morning sky
but ere the shades of evening close
is scattered on the ground--to die
yet on the rose's humble bed
the sweetest dews of night are shed
as if she wept the waste to see --
but none shall weep a tear for me
that trembles in the moon's pale ray
its hold is frail --its date is brief
restless --and soon to pass away
yet ere that leaf shall fall and fade
the parent tree will mourn its shade
the winds bewail the leafless tree --
but none shall breathe a sigh for me
have left on tampa's desert strand
soon as the rising tide shall beat
all trace will vanish from the sand
yet as if grieving to efface
all vestige of the human race
on that lone shore loud moans the sea --
but none alas shall mourn for me
thy birth was in the forest shades
green boughs and glimpses of the sky
were all that met thine infant eye
were ever in the sylvan wild
and all the beauty of the place
is in thy heart and on thy face
is in the light shade of thy locks
thy step is as the wind that weaves
its playful way among the leaves
and silent waters heaven is seen
their lashes are the herbs that look
on their young figures in the brook
are not more sinless than thy breast
the holy peace that fills the air
of those calm solitudes is there
when fond recollection presents them to view --
the orchard the meadow the deep-tangled wild-wood
and every loved spot which my infancy knew
the wide-spreading pond and the mill that stood by it
the bridge and the rock where the cataract fell
the cot of my father the dairy-house nigh it
and e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well --
the old oaken bucket the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket which hung in the well
for often at noon when returned from the field
i found it the source of an exquisite pleasure --
the purest and sweetest that nature can yield
how ardent i seized it with hands that were glowing
and quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell
then soon with the emblem of truth overflowing
and dripping with coolness it rose from the well
the old oaken bucket the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket arose from the well
as poised on the curb it inclined to my lips
not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it
the brightest that beauty or revelry sips
and now far removed from the loved habitation
the tear of regret will intrusively swell
as fancy reverts to my father's plantation
and sighs for the bucket that hangs in the well --
the old oaken bucket the iron-bound bucket
the moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well
in a kingdom by the sea
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me
in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
i and my annabel lee
with a love that the wing d seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me
in this kingdom by the sea
a wind blew out of a cloud chilling
my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea
went envying her and me
yes that was the reason as all men know
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night
chilling and killing my annabel lee
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above
nor the demons down under the sea
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee
of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee
and so all the night-tide i lie down by the side
of my darling --my darling --my life and my bride
in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the sounding sea
of loveliness alone --
a woman of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
to whom the better elements
and kindly stars have given
a form so fair that like the air
'tis less of earth than heaven
like those of morning birds
and something more than melody
dwells ever in her words
the coinage of her heart are they
and from her lips each flows
as one may see the burden'd bee
forth issue from the rose
the measures of her hours
her feelings have the fragrancy
the freshness of young flowers
and lovely passions changing oft
so fill her she appears
the image of themselves by turns --
the idol of past years
a picture on the brain
and of her voice in echoing hearts
a sound must long remain
but memory such as mine of her
so very much endears
when death is nigh my latest sigh
will not be life's but hers
of loveliness alone --
a woman of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
her health and would on earth there stood
some more of such a frame
that life might be all poetry
and weariness a name
and shame them with thine eyes
on which than on the lights above
there hang more destinies
night's beauty is the harmony
of blending shades and light
then lady up --look out and be
a sister to the night
within my watching breast
sleep not --from her soft sleep should fly
who robs all hearts of rest
nay lady from thy slumbers break
and make this darkness gay
with looks whose brightness well might make
of darker nights a day
in a strange city lying alone
far down within the dim west
where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
have gone to their eternal rest
there shrines and palaces and towers
time-eaten towers that tremble not
resemble nothing that is ours
around by lifting winds forgot
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
on the long night-time of that town
but light from out the lurid sea
streams up the turrets silently
gleams up the pinnacles far and free
up domes up spires up kingly halls
up fanes up babylon-like walls
up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
up many and many a marvellous shrine
whose wreath d friezes intertwine
the viol the violet and the vine
the melancholy waters lie
so blend the turrets and shadows there
that all seem pendulous in air
while from a proud tower in the town
death looks gigantically down
yawn level with the luminous waves
but not the riches there that lie
in each idol's diamond eye --
not the gaily-jewelled dead
tempt the waters from their bed
for no ripples curl alas
along that wilderness of glass
no swellings tell that winds may be
upon some far-off happier sea
no heavings hint that winds have been
on seas less hideously serene
the wave--there is a movement there
as if the towers had thrust aside
in slightly sinking the dull tide
as if their tops had feebly given
a void within the filmy heaven
the waves have now a redder glow
the hours are breathing faint and low
and when amid no earthly moans
down down that town shall settle hence
hell rising from a thousand thrones
shall do it reverence
strong are the barriers round thy dark domain
and fetters sure and fast
hold all that enter thy unbreathing reign
old empires sit in sullenness and gloom
and glorious ages gone
lie deep within the shadow of thy womb
youth manhood age that draws us to the ground
and last man's life on earth
glide to thy dim dominions and are bound
thou hast my earlier friends the good the kind
yielded to thee with tears --
the venerable form the exalted mind
the lost ones back --yearns with desire intense
and struggles hard to wring
thy bolts apart and pluck thy captives thence
all passage save to those who hence depart
nor to the streaming eye
thou giv'st them back --nor to the broken heart
beauty and excellence unknown to thee
earth's wonder and her pride
are gathered as the waters to the sea
unpublished charity unbroken faith
love that midst grief began
and grew with years and faltered not in death
lurks in thy depths unuttered unrevered
with thee are silent fame
forgotten arts and wisdom disappeared
yet shalt thou yield thy treasures up at last
thy gates shall yet give way
thy bolts shall fall inexorable past
has gone into thy womb from earliest time
shall then come forth to wear
the glory and the beauty of its prime
kind words remembered voices once so sweet
smiles radiant long ago
and features the great soul's apparent seat
of pure affection shall be knit again
alone shall evil die
and sorrow dwell a prisoner in thy reign
him by whose kind paternal side i sprung
and her who still and cold
fills the next grave --the beautiful and young
has the sweetest voice of all god's creatures
whose heart-strings are a lute
none sing so wildly well
as the angel israfel
and the giddy stars so legends tell
ceasing their hymns attend the spell
of his voice all mute
in her highest noon
the enamored moon
blushes with love
while to listen the red levin
with the rapid pleiads even
which were seven
pauses in heaven
and the other listening things
that israfeli's fire
is owing to that lyre
by which he sits and sings --
the trembling living wire
of those unusual strings
where deep thoughts are a duty
where love's a grown-up god
where the houri glances are
imbued with all the beauty
which we worship in a star
israfeli who despisest
an unimpassioned song
to thee the laurels belong
best bard because the wisest
merrily live and long
with thy burning measures suit
thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love
with the fervor of thy lute
well may the stars be mute
is a world of sweets and sours
our flowers are merely--flowers
and the shadow of thy perfect bliss
is the sunshine of ours
where israfel
hath dwelt and he where i
he might not sing so wildly well
a mortal melody
while a bolder note than this might swell
from my lyre within the sky
'twas near the twilight-tide --
and slowly there a lady fair
was walking in her pride
alone walked she but viewlessly
walked spirits at her side
and honor charmed the air
and all astir looked kind on her
and called her good as fair--
for all god ever gave to her
she kept with chary care
from lovers warm and true
for her heart was cold to all but gold
and the rich came not to woo
but honored well are charms to sell
if priests the selling do
a slight girl lily-pale
and she had unseen company
to make the spirit quail --
'twixt want and scorn she walked forlorn
and nothing could avail
for this world's peace to pray
for as love's wild prayer dissolved in air
her woman's heart gave way
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven
by man is cursed alway
by good angels tenanted
once a fair and stately palace--
radiant palace--reared its head
in the monarch thought's dominion
it stood there
never seraph spread a pinion
over fabric half so fair
on its roof did float and flow
this--all this--was in the olden
time long ago
and every gentle air that dallied
in that sweet day
along the ramparts plumed and pallid
a wing d odor went away
through two luminous windows saw
spirits moving musically
to a lute's well-tun d law
round about a throne where sitting
porphyrogene
in state his glory well befitting
the ruler of the realm was seen
was the fair palace door
through which came flowing flowing flowing
and sparkling evermore
a troop of echoes whose sweet duty
was but to sing
in voices of surpassing beauty
the wit and wisdom of their king
assailed the monarch's high estate
ah let us mourn for never morrow
shall dawn upon him desolate
and round about his home the glory
that blushed and bloomed
is but a dim-remembered story
of the old time entombed
through the red-litten windows see
vast forms that move fantastically
to a discordant melody
while like a ghastly rapid river
through the pale door
a hideous throng rush out forever
and laugh--but smile no more
while glow the heavens with the last steps of day
far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue
thy solitary way
might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong
as darkly painted on the crimson sky
thy figure floats along
of weedy lake or marge of river wide
or where the rocking billows rise and sink
on the chafed ocean-side
teaches thy way along that pathless coast--
the desert and illimitable air--
lone wandering but not lost
at that far height the cold thin atmosphere
yet stoop not weary to the welcome land
though the dark night is near
soon shalt thou find a summer home and rest
and scream among thy fellows reeds shall bend
soon o'er thy sheltered nest
hath swallowed up thy form yet on my heart
deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given
and shall not soon depart
guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight
in the long way that i must tread alone
will lead my steps aright
like those nic an barks of yore
that gently o'er a perfumed sea
the weary wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore
thy hyacinth hair thy classic face
thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece
and the grandeur that was rome
how statue-like i see thee stand
the agate lamp within thy hand
ah psyche from the regions which
are holy land
does the wine our goblets gleam in
with hue as red as the rosy bed
which a bee would choose to dream in
then fill to-night with hearts as light
to loves as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim
and break on the lips while meeting
of time through life's dominions
we here awhile would now beguile
the graybeard of his pinions
to drink to-night with hearts as light
to loves as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim
and break on the lips while meeting
nor fond regret delay him
nor love himself can hold the elf
nor sober friendship stay him
we'll drink to-night with hearts as light
to loves as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim
and break on the lips while meeting
for which my soul did pine
a green isle in the sea love
a fountain and a shrine
all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
and all the flowers were mine
ah starry hope that didst arise
but to be overcast
a voice from out the future cries
on on --but o'er the past
dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
mute motionless aghast
the light of life is o'er
no more--no more--no more--
such language holds the solemn sea
to the sands upon the shore
shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
or the stricken eagle soar
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy gray eye glances
and where thy footstep gleams --
in what ethereal dances
by what eternal streams
friend of my better days
none knew thee but to love thee
nor named thee but to praise
from eyes unused to weep
and long where thou art lying
will tears the cold turf steep
like thine are laid in earth
there should a wreath be woven
to tell the world their worth
to clasp thy hand in mine
who shared thy joy and sorrow
whose weal and woe were thine
around thy faded brow
but i've in vain essayed it
and feel i cannot now
nor thoughts nor words are free
the grief is fixed too deeply
that mourns a man like thee
where the people did not dwell
they had gone unto the wars
trusting to the mild-eyed stars
nightly from their azure towers
to keep watch above the flowers
in the midst of which all day
the red sunlight lazily lay
now each visitor shall confess
the sad valley's restlessness
nothing there is motionless
nothing save the airs that brood
over the magic solitude
ah by no wind are stirred those trees
that palpitate like the chill seas
around the misty hebrides
ah by no wind those clouds are driven
that rustle through the unquiet heaven
uneasily from morn to even
over the violets there that lie
in myriad types of the human eye
over the lilies there that wave
and weep above a nameless grave
they wave --from out their fragrant tops
eternal dews come down in drops
they weep --from off their delicate stems
perennial tears descend in gems
and colored with the heaven's own blue
that openest when the quiet light
succeeds the keen and frosty night
o'er wandering brooks and springs unseen
or columbines in purple dressed
nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest
when woods are bare and birds are flown
and frosts and shortening days portend
the aged year is near his end
look through its fringes to the sky
blue--blue--as if that sky let fall
a flower from its cerulean wall
the hour of death draw near to me
hope blossoming within my heart
may look to heaven as i depart
filled with an ever-shifting train
amid the sound of steps that beat
the murmuring walks like autumn rain
the mild the fierce the stony face --
some bright with thoughtless smiles and some
where secret tears have left their trace
to halls in which the feast is spread
to chambers where the funeral guest
in silence sits beside the dead
where children pressing cheek to cheek
with mute caresses shall declare
the tenderness they cannot speak
shall shudder as they reach the door
where one who made their dwelling dear
its flower its light is seen no more
and dreams of greatness in thine eye
go'st thou to build an early name
or early in the task to die
who is now fluttering in thy snare
thy golden fortunes tower they now
or melt the glittering spires in air
the dance till daylight gleam again
who sorrow o'er the untimely dead
who writhe in throes of mortal pain
the cold dark hours how slow the light
and some who flaunt amid the throng
shall hide in dens of shame to-night
they pass and heed each other not
there is who heeds who holds them all
in his large love and boundless thought
in wayward aimless course to tend
are eddies of the mighty stream
that rolls to its appointed end
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore --
while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
as of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door
'tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door --
only this and nothing more
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow --vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore --
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore --
nameless here forevermore
thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
--some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door --
this it is and nothing more
sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore
but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping
and so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door
that i scarce was sure i heard you --here i opened wide the door --
darkness there and nothing more
doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore
this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore
merely this and nothing more
soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before
surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice
let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore --
let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore --
'tis the wind and nothing more
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he
but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door--
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door--
perched and sat and nothing more
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure
no craven
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore --
tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore
quoth the raven nevermore
though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door--
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
with such name as nevermore
that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before--
on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said nevermore
doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store
caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
of 'never--nevermore '
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking
fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking nevermore
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core
this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining
on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
she shall press ah nevermore
swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee--by these angels he hath
sent thee
respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore
quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven nevermore
whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted--
on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly i implore --
is there -- is there balm in gilead --tell me--tell me i implore
quoth the raven nevermore
by that heaven that bends above us--by that god we both adore--
tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore--
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven nevermore
upstarting --
get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbroken --quit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven nevermore
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted --nevermore
were trampled by a hurrying crowd
and fiery hearts and arm d hands
encountered in the battle-cloud
how gushed the life-blood of her brave --
gushed warm with hope and courage yet
upon the soil they fought to save
alone the chirp of flitting bird
and talk of children on the hill
and bell of wandering kine are heard
the black-mouthed gun and staggering wain
men start not at the battle-cry
oh be it never heard again
who minglest in the harder strife
for truths which men receive not now
thy warfare only ends with life
through weary day and weary year
a wild and many-weaponed throng
hang on thy front and flank and rear
and blench not at thy chosen lot
the timid good may stand aloof
the sage may frown --yet faint thou not
the foul and hissing bolt of scorn
for with thy side shall dwell at last
the victory of endurance born
the eternal years of god are hers
but error wounded writhes in pain
and dies among his worshippers
when they who helped thee flee in fear
die full of hope and manly trust
like those who fell in battle here
another hand the standard wave
till from the trumpet's mouth is pealed
the blast of triumph o'er thy grave
i stand beneath the mystic moon
an opiate vapor dewy dim
exhales from out her golden rim
and softly dripping drop by drop
upon the quiet mountain-top
steals drowsily and musically
into the universal valley
the rosemary nods upon the grave
the lily lolls upon the wave
wrapping the fog about its breast
the ruin moulders into rest
looking like lethe see the lake
a conscious slumber seems to take
and would not for the world awake
all beauty sleeps --and lo where lies
irene with her destinies
this window open to the night
the wanton airs from the tree-top
laughingly through the lattice drop
the bodiless airs a wizard rout
flit through thy chamber in and out
and wave the curtain canopy
so fitfully so fearfully
above the closed and fringed lid
'neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid
that o'er the floor and down the wall
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
o lady dear hast thou no fear
why and what art thou dreaming here
sure thou art come o'er far-off seas
a wonder to these garden trees
strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
strange above all thy length of tress
and this all solemn silentness
which is enduring so be deep
heaven have her in its sacred keep
this chamber changed for one more holy
this bed for one more melancholy
i pray to god that she may lie
forever with unopened eye
while the pale sheeted ghosts go by
as it is lasting so be deep
soft may the worms about her creep
far in the forest dim and old
for her may some tall vault unfold
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and wing d panels fluttering back
triumphant o'er the crested palls
of her grand family funerals
some sepulchre remote alone
against whose portal she hath thrown
in childhood many an idle stone
some tomb from out whose sounding door
she ne'er shall force an echo more
thrilling to think poor child of sin
it was the dead who groaned within
leads by the hand her little child to bed
half willing half reluctant to be led
and leave his broken playthings on the floor
still gazing at them through the open door
nor wholly reassured and comforted
by promises of others in their stead
which though more splendid may not please him more --
so nature deals with us and takes away
our playthings one by one and by the hand
leads us to rest so gently that we go
scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay
being too full of sleep to understand
how far the unknown transcends the what we know
i saw the flash of robes descending
before her ran an influence fleet
that bowed my heart like barley bending
pilot to blooms beyond our finding
it led me on by sweet degrees
joy's simple honey-cells unbinding
with nearer love the sky leaned o'er me
the long-sought secret's golden gates
on musical hinges swung before me
thrilling with godhood like a lover
i sprang the proffered life to clasp --
the beaker fell the luck was over
what boots it patch the goblet's splinters
can summer fill the icy cup
whose treacherous crystal is but winter's
their nectar crowns the lips of patience
haste scatters on unthankful sods
the immortal gift in vain libations
and shuns the hands would seize upon her
follow thy life and she will sue
to pour for thee the cup of honor
falls from the wings of night
as a feather is wafted downward
from an eagle in his flight
gleam through the rain and the mist
and a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
that my soul cannot resist
that is not akin to pain
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
some simple and heartfelt lay
that shall soothe this restless feeling
and banish the thoughts of day
not from the bards sublime
whose distant footsteps echo
through the corridors of time
their mighty thoughts suggest
life's endless toil and endeavor
and to-night i long for rest
whose songs gushed from his heart
as showers from the clouds of summer
or tears from the eyelids start
and nights devoid of ease
still heard in his soul the music
of wonderful melodies
the restless pulse of care
and come like the benediction
that follows after prayer
the poem of thy choice
and lend to the rhyme of the poet
the beauty of thy voice
and the cares that infest the day
shall fold their tents like the arabs
and as silently steal away
which once he wore
the glory from his gray hairs gone
forevermore
a snare for all
and pitying tears not scorn and wrath
befit his fall
when he who might
have lighted up and led his age
falls back in night
a bright soul driven
fiend-goaded down the endless dark
from hope and heaven
insult him now
nor brand with deeper shame his dim
dishonored brow
from sea to lake
a long lament as for the dead
in sadness make
save power remains --
a fallen angel's pride of thought
still strong in chains
the soul has fled
when faith is lost when honor dies
the man is dead
to his dead fame
walk backward with averted gaze
and hide the shame
sailed the corsair death
wild and fast blew the blast
and the east-wind was his breath
glisten in the sun
on each side like pennons wide
flashing crystal streamlets run
dripped with silver rain
but where he passed there were cast
leaden shadows o'er the main
sir humphrey gilbert sailed
three days or more seaward he bore
then alas the land-wind failed
and ice-cold grew the night
and nevermore on sea or shore
should sir humphrey see the light
the book was in his hand
do not fear heaven is as near
he said by water as by land
without a signal's sound
out of the sea mysteriously
the fleet of death rose all around
were hanging in the shrouds
every mast as it passed
seemed to rake the passing clouds
at midnight black and cold
as of a rock was the shock
heavily the ground-swell rolled
they drift in close embrace
with mist and rain o'er the open main
yet there seems no change of place
they drift through dark and day
and like a dream in the gulf stream
sinking vanish all away
their flag to april's breeze unfurled
here once the embattled farmers stood
and fired the shot heard round the world
alike the conqueror silent sleeps
and time the ruined bridge has swept
down the dark stream which seaward creeps
we set to-day a votive stone
that memory may their deed redeem
when like our sires our sons are gone
to die and leave their children free
bid time and nature gently spare
the shaft we raise to them and thee
stilt its decrepit strength renew its age
wipe out its debts contract a loan to wage
its venal battles --and by yon bright sun
our god is false and liberty undone
if slaves have power to win your heritage
look on your country god's appointed stage
where man's vast mind its boundless course shall run
for that it was your stormy coast he spread--
a fear in winter girded you about
with granite hills and made you strong and dread
let him who fears before the foemen shout
or gives an inch before a vein has bled
turn on himself and let the traitor out
long has it waved on high
and many an eye has danced to see
that banner in the sky
beneath it rung the battle shout
and burst the cannon's roar --
the meteor of the ocean air
shall sweep the clouds no more
where knelt the vanquished foe
when winds were hurrying o'er the flood
and waves were white below
no more shall feel the victor's tread
or know the conquered knee
the harpies of the shore shall pluck
the eagle of the sea
should sink beneath the wave
her thunders shook the mighty deep
and there should be her grave
set every threadbare sail
and give her to the god of storms
the lightning and the gale
before thy shakespeare gave it deathless fame
the times have changed the moral is the same
so like an outcast dowerless and pale
thy daughter went and in a foreign gale
spread her young banner till its sway became
a wonder to the nations days of shame
are close upon thee prophets raise their wail
when the rude cossack with an outstretched hand
points his long spear across the narrow sea --
lo there is england when thy destiny
storms on thy straw-crowned head and thou dost stand
weak helpless mad a by-word in the land --
god grant thy daughter a cordelia be
thou rock of shelter rising from the wave
sole refuge to the overwearied brave
who planned arose and battled to be free
fell undeterred then sadly turned to thee
saved the free spirit from their country's grave
to rise again and animate the slave
when god shall ripen all things britons ye
who guard the sacred outpost not in vain
hold your proud peril freemen undefiled
keep watch and ward let battlements be piled
around your cliffs fleets marshalled till the main
sink under them and if your courage wane
through force or fraud look westward to your child
that sailed the wintry sea
and the skipper had taken his little daught r
to bear him company
her cheeks like the dawn of day
and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds
that ope in the month of may
his pipe was in his mouth
and he watched how the veering flaw did blow
the smoke now west now south
had sailed to the spanish main
i pray thee put into yonder port
for i fear a hurricane
and to-night no moon we see
the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe
and a scornful laugh laughed he
a gale from the northeast
the snow fell hissing in the brine
and the billows frothed like yeast
the vessel in its strength
she shuddered and paused like a frightened steed
then leaped her cable's length
and do not tremble so
for i can weather the roughest gale
that ever wind did blow
against the stinging blast
he cut a rope from a broken spar
and bound her to the mast
oh say what may it be
'tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast --
and he steered for the open sea
oh say what may it be
some ship in distress that cannot live
in such an angry sea
oh say what may it be
but the father answered never a word
a frozen corpse was he
with his face turned to the skies
the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
on his fixed and glassy eyes
that sav d she might be
and she thought of christ who stilled the wave
on the lake of galilee
through the whistling sleet and snow
like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept
tow'rds the reef of norman's woe
a sound came from the land
it was the sound of the trampling surf
on the rocks and the hard sea-sand
she drifted a dreary wreck
and a whooping billow swept the crew
like icicles from her deck
looked soft as carded wool
but the cruel rocks they gored her side
like the horns of an angry bull
with the masts went by the board
like a vessel of glass she stove and sank
ho ho the breakers roared
a fisherman stood aghast
to see the form of a maiden fair
lashed close to a drifting mast
the salt tears in her eyes
and he saw her hair like the brown sea-weed
on the billows fall and rise
in the midnight and the snow
christ save us all from a death like this
on the reef of norman's woe
on a stallion shod with fire
and the winds are left behind
in the speed of my desire
under thy window i stand
and the midnight hears my cry
i love thee i love but thee
with a love that shall not die
till the sun grows cold
and the stars are old
and the leaves of the judgment book unfold
my passion and my pain
i lie on the sands below
and i faint in thy disdain
let the night-winds touch thy brow
with the heat of my burning sigh
and melt thee to hear the vow
of a love that shall not die
till the sun grows cold
and the stars are old
and the leaves of the judgment book unfold
by the fever in my breast
to hear from thy lattice breathed
the word that shall give me rest
open the door of thy heart
and open thy chamber door
and my kisses shall teach thy lips
the love that shall fade no more
till the sun grows cold
and the stars are old
and the leaves of the judgment book unfold
told in story or sung in rhyme --
on apuleius's golden ass
or one-eyed calendar's horse of brass
witch astride of a human back
islam's prophet on al-borak --
the strangest ride that ever was sped
was ireson's out from marblehead
old floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl
feathered and ruffled in every part
skipper ireson stood in the cart
scores of women old and young
strong of muscle and glib of tongue
pushed and pulled up the rocky lane
shouting and singing the shrill refrain
here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead
girls in bloom of cheek and lips
wild-eyed free-limbed such as chase
bacchus round some antique vase
brief of skirt with ankles bare
loose of kerchief and loose of hair
with conch-shells blowing and fish-horns' twang
over and over the m nads sang
here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead
from a leaking ship in chaleur bay --
sailed away from a sinking wreck
with his own town's-people on her deck
lay by lay by they called to him
back he answered sink or swim
brag of your catch of fish again
and off he sailed through the fog and rain
old floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
that wreck shall lie forevermore
mother and sister wife and maid
looked from the rocks of marblehead
over the moaning and rainy sea --
looked for the coming that might not be
what did the winds and the sea-birds say
of the cruel captain who sailed away --
old floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
up flew windows doors swung wide
sharp-tongued spinsters old wives gray
treble lent the fish-horn's bray
sea-worn grandsires cripple-bound
hulks of old sailors run aground
shook head and fist and hat and cane
and cracked with curses the hoarse refrain
here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead
bloom of orchard and lilac showed
little the wicked skipper knew
of the fields so green and the sky so blue
riding there in his sorry trim
like an indian idol glum and grim
scarcely he seemed the sound to hear
of voices shouting far and near
here's flud oirson fur his horrd horrt
torr'd an' futherr'd an' corr'd in a corrt
by the women o' morble'ead
what to me is this noisy ride
what is the shame that clothes the skin
to the nameless horror that lives within
waking or sleeping i see a wreck
and hear a cry from a reeling deck
hate me and curse me --i only dread
the hand of god and the face of the dead
said old floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
said god has touched him why should we
said an old wife mourning her only son
cut the rogue's tether and let him run
so with soft relentings and rude excuse
half scorn half pity they cut him loose
and gave him a cloak to hide him in
and left him alone with his shame and sin
poor floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
the village smithy stands
the smith a mighty man is he
with large and sinewy hands
and the muscles of his brawny arms
are strong as iron bands
his face is like the tan
his brow is wet with honest sweat
he earns whate'er he can
and looks the whole world in the face
for he owes not any man
you can hear his bellows blow
you can hear him swing his heavy sledge
with measured beat and slow
like a sexton ringing the village bell
when the evening sun is low
look in at the open door
they love to see the flaming forge
and hear the bellows roar
and catch the burning sparks that fly
like chaff from a threshing-floor
and sits among his boys
he hears the parson pray and preach
he hears his daughter's voice
singing in the village choir
and it makes his heart rejoice
singing in paradise
he needs must think of her once more
how in the grave she lies
and with his hard rough hand he wipes
a tear out of his eyes
onward through life he goes
each morning sees some task begin
each evening sees it close
something attempted something done
has earned a night's repose
for the lesson thou hast taught
thus at the flaming forge of life
our fortunes must be wrought
thus on its sounding anvil shaped
each burning deed and thought
as he passed by the door
and again
the pavement stones resound
as he totters o'er the ground
with his cane
ere the pruning-knife of time
cut him down
not a better man was found
by the crier on his round
through the town
and he looks at all he meets
sad and wan
and he shakes his feeble head
that it seems as if he said
they are gone
on the lips that he has pressed
in their bloom
and the names he loved to hear
have been carved for many a year
on the tomb
poor old lady she is dead
long ago--
that he had a roman nose
and his cheek was like a rose
in the snow
and it rests upon his chin
like a staff
and a crook is in his back
and a melancholy crack
in his laugh
for me to sit and grin
at him here
but the old three-cornered hat
and the breeches and all that
are so queer
the last leaf upon the tree
in the spring
let them smile as i do now
at the old forsaken bough
where i cling
'tis summer the darkies are gay
the corn-top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom
while the birds make music all the day
the young folks roll on the little cabin floor
all merry all happy and bright
by-'n'-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door --
then my old kentucky home good-night
oh weep no more to-day
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home
for the old kentucky home far away
on the meadow the hill and the shore
they sing no more by the glimmer of the moon
on the bench by the old cabin door
the day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart
with sorrow where all was delight
the time has come when the darkies have to part --
then my old kentucky home good-night
wherever the darkey may go
a few more days and the trouble all will end
in the field where the sugar-canes grow
a few more days for to tote the weary load --
no matter 'twill never be light
a few more days till we totter on the road --
then my old kentucky home good-night
oh weep no more to-day
we will sing one song for the old kentucky home
for the old kentucky home far away
ranked in the western heaven
waiting the breath that lifts
all the dread mass and drifts
tempest and falling brand
over a ruined land --
so still and orderly
arm to arm knee to knee
waiting the great event
stands the black regiment
teeth gleam and eyeballs shine
and the bright bayonet
bristling and firmly set
flashed with a purpose grand
long ere the sharp command
of the fierce rolling drum
told them their time had come
told them what work was sent
for the black regiment
though death and hell betide
let the whole nation see
if we are fit to be
free in this land or bound
down like the whining hound --
bound with red stripes of pain
in our old chains again
oh what a shout there went
from the black regiment
onward the bondmen broke
bayonet and sabre-stroke
vainly opposed their rush
through the wild battle's crush
with but one thought aflush
driving their lords like chaff
in the guns' mouths they laugh
or at the slippery brands
leaping with open hands
down they tear man and horse
down in their awful course
trampling with bloody heel
over the crashing steel
all their eyes forward bent
rushed the black regiment
freedom or leave to die
ah and they meant the word
not as with us 'tis heard
not a mere party shout
they gave their spirits out
trusted the end to god
and on the gory sod
rolled in triumphant blood
glad to strike one free blow
whether for weal or woe
glad to breathe one free breath
though on the lips of death
praying--alas in vain --
that they might fall again
so they could once more see
that burst to liberty
this was what freedom lent
to the black regiment
but they are resting well
scourges and shackles strong
never shall do them wrong
oh to the living few
soldiers be just and true
hail them as comrades tried
fight with them side by side
never in field or tent
scorn the black regiment
thy pines give shelter to his bands
thy sons stand by with idle hands
carolina
he breathes at ease thy airs of balm
he scorns the lances of thy palm
oh who shall break thy craven calm
carolina
thy ancient fame is growing dim
a spot is on thy garment's rim
give to the winds thy battle-hymn
carolina
wake swamp and river coast and rill
rouse all thy strength and all thy skill
carolina
cite wealth and science trade and art
touch with thy fire the cautious mart
and pour thee through the people's heart
carolina
till even the coward spurns his fears
and all thy fields and fens and meres
shall bristle like thy palm with spears
carolina
that grope their way through sunless caves
like bodies struggling in their graves
carolina
and now it deepens slow and grand
it swells as rolling to the land
an ocean broke upon thy strand
carolina
shout let it reach the startled huns
and roar with all thy festal guns
it is the answer of thy sons
carolina
what to him is friend or foeman
rise of moon or set of sun
hand of man or kiss of woman
lay him low lay him low
in the clover or the snow
what cares he he cannot know
lay him low
proved his truth by his endeavor
let him sleep in solemn night
sleep forever and forever
lay him low lay him low
in the clover or the snow
what cares he he cannot know
lay him low
roll the drum and fire the volley
what to him are all our wars
what but death bemocking folly
lay him low lay him low
in the clover or the snow
what cares he he cannot know
lay him low
trust him to the hand that made him
mortal love weeps idly by
god alone has power to aid him
lay him low lay him low
in the clover or the snow
what cares he he cannot know
lay him low
he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
he hath loosed the fatal lightning of his terrible swift sword
his truth is marching on
they have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps
i can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
his day is marching on
as ye deal with my contemners so with you my grace shall deal
let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel
since god is marching on
he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat
oh be swift my soul to answer him be jubilant my feet
our god is marching on
with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me
as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free
while god is marching on

thunderbolt stroke
watches the hoary mist
lift from the bay
till his flag glory-kissed
greets the young day
looms the black fleet
hark deck to rampart calls
with the drums' beat
buoy your chains overboard
while the steam hums
men to the battlement
farragut comes
hurtles in wrath
squadrons of clouds amain
back from its path
back to the parapet
to the guns' lips
thunderbolt farragut
hurls the black ships
clear the boy sings
by the mark fathoms four
while his lead swings
steady the wheelmen five
nor' by east keep her
steady but two alive
how the shells sweep her
over red decks
over the flame that plays
round the torn wrecks
over the dying lips
framed for a cheer
farragut leads his ships
guides the line clear
while the spars quiver
onward still flames the cloud
where the hulks shiver
see yon fort's star is set
storm and fire past
cheer him lads --farragut

while the gulf's towering crest
tops a green vale

the work of the reaper is done
and the golden woodlands redden
in the blood of the dying sun
sits pale in his easy-chair
while a gentle wind of twilight
plays with his silver hair
a fair young head is prest
in the first wild passion of sorrow
against his aged breast
the faltering echoes come
of the flying blast of trumpet
and the rattling roll of drum
the end no man can see
but we give him to his country
and we give our prayers to thee
the rose-buds fringe the door
and over the grassy orchard
the pink-white blossoms pour
the cottage is dark and still
there's a nameless grave in the battle-field
and a new one under the hill
by the cold hearth sits alone
and the old clock in the corner
ticks on with a steady drone
the outer trenches guarding
when the heated guns of the camps allied
grew weary of bombarding
lay grim and threatening under
and the tawny mound of the malakoff
no longer belch'd its thunder
we storm the forts to-morrow
sing while we may another day
will bring enough of sorrow
below the smoking cannon
brave hearts from severn and from clyde
and from the banks of shannon
forgot was britain's glory
each heart recall'd a different name
but all sang annie laurie
until its tender passion
rose like an anthem rich and strong --
their battle-eve confession
but as the song grew louder
something upon the soldier's cheek
washed off the stains of powder
the bloody sunset's embers
while the crimean valleys learn'd
how english love remembers
rain'd on the russian quarters
with scream of shot and burst of shell
and bellowing of the mortars
for a singer dumb and gory
and english mary mourns for him
who sang of annie laurie
your truth and valor wearing
the bravest are the tenderest --
the loving are the daring
with little thought or care
whether my waking find
me here or there
that only asks to rest
unquestioning upon
a loving breast
its cunning now
to march the weary march
i know not how
nor strong--all that is past
i am ready not to do
at last at last
and this is all my part
i give a patient god
my patient heart
though all its blue be dim
these stripes no less than stars
lead after him
no more her pulses come and go
her eyes are shut to life and light --
fold the white vesture snow on snow
and lay her where the violets blow
to plead for tears with alien eyes
a slender cross of wood alone
shall say that here a maiden lies
in peace beneath the peaceful skies
shall wheel their circling shadows round
to make the scorching sunlight dim
that drinks the greenness from the ground
and drop their dead leaves on her mound
and through their leaves the robins call
and ripening in the autumn sun
the acorns and the chestnuts fall
doubt not that she will heed them all
its matins from the branches high
and every minstrel voice of spring
that trills beneath the april sky
shall greet her with its earliest cry
eastward the lengthening shadows pass
her little mourners clad in black
the crickets sliding through the grass
shall pipe for her an evening mass
shall find the prison where she lies
and bear the buried dust they seize
in leaves and blossoms to the skies
so may the soul that warmed it rise
should ask what maiden lies below
say only this a tender bud
that tried to blossom in the snow
lies withered where the violets blow
muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes
and marching single in an endless file
bring diadems and fagots in their hands
to each they offer gifts after his will
bread kingdoms stars and sky that holds them all
i in my pleach d garden watched the pomp
forgot my morning wishes hastily
took a few herbs and apples and the day
turned and departed silent i too late
under her solemn fillet saw the scorn
his box is next to ours
who threw the prima donna
the wreath of orange-flowers
he owns the half of aragon
with mines beyond the main
a very ancient nobleman
and gentleman of spain
in spite of yea or nay
though uglier than the scaramouch
the spectre in the play
but i will sooner die a maid
than wear a gilded chain
for all the ancient noblemen
and gentlemen of spain
scribner's sons
and lived in a cellar damp
i had not a friend nor a toy
but i had aladdin's lamp
when i could not sleep for cold
i had fire enough in my brain
and builded with roofs of gold
my beautiful castles in spain
i have money and power good store
but i'd give all my lamps of silver bright
for the one that is mine no more
take fortune whatever you choose --
you gave and may snatch again
i have nothing 'twould pain me to lose
for i own no more castles in spain
there are balms for all our pain
but when youth the dream departs
it takes something from our hearts
and it never comes again
under manhood's sterner reign
still we feel that something sweet
followed youth with flying feet
and will never come again
and we sigh for it in vain
we behold it everywhere
on the earth and in the air
but it never comes again
scribner's sons
their song was soft and low
the blossoms in the sweet may wind
were falling like the snow
the orchard birds sang clear
the sweetest and the saddest day
it seemed of all the year
my playmate left her home
and took with her the laughing spring
the music and the bloom
she laid her hand in mine
what more could ask the bashful boy
who fed her father's kine
the constant years told o'er
their seasons with as sweet may morns
but she came back no more
of uneventful years
still o'er and o'er i sow the spring
and reap the autumn ears
her summer roses blow
the dusky children of the sun
before her come and go
she smooths her silken gown --
no more the homespun lap wherein
i shook the walnuts down
the brown nuts on the hill
and still the may-day flowers make sweet
the woods of follymill
the bird builds in the tree
the dark pines sing on ramoth hill
the slow song of the sea
and how the old time seems
if ever the pines of ramoth wood
are sounding in her dreams
does she remember mine
and what to her is now the boy
who fed her father's kine
for other eyes than ours --
that other hands with nuts are filled
and other laps with flowers
our mossy seat is green
its fringing violets blossom yet
the old trees o'er it lean
a sweeter memory blow
and there in spring the veeries sing
the song of long ago
are moaning like the sea --
the moaning of the sea of change
between myself and thee
whose windows looking o'er the bay
gave to the sea-breeze damp and cold
an easy entrance night and day
the strange old-fashioned silent town
the lighthouse the dismantled fort
the wooden houses quaint and brown
descending filled the little room
our faces faded from the sight
our voices only broke the gloom
of what we once had thought and said
of what had been and might have been
and who was changed and who was dead
when first they feel with secret pain
their lives thenceforth have separate ends
and never can be one again
that words are powerless to express
and leave it still unsaid in part
or say it in too great excess
had something strange i could but mark
the leaves of memory seemed to make
a mournful rustling in the dark
as suddenly from out the fire
built of the wreck of stranded ships
the flames would leap and then expire
we thought of wrecks upon the main
of ships dismasted that were hailed
and sent no answer back again
the ocean roaring up the beach
the gusty blast the bickering flames
all mingled vaguely in our speech
of fancies floating through the brain
the long-lost ventures of the heart
that send no answers back again
they were indeed too much akin
the driftwood fire without that burned
the thoughts that burned and glowed within
yet lived she at its close
and breathed the long long night away
in statue-like repose
illumed the eastern skies
she passed through glory's morning gate
and walked in paradise
runs the path i took
you can see the gap in the old wall still
and the stepping-stones in the shallow brook
and the poplars tall
and the barn's brown length and the cattle-yard
and the white horns tossing above the wall
and down by the brink
of the brook are her poor flowers weed-o'errun --
pansy and daffodil rose and pink
heavy and slow
and the same rose blows and the same sun glows
and the same brook sings of a year ago
and the june sun warm
tangles his wings of fire in the trees
setting as then over fernside farm
from my sunday coat
i brushed off the burrs and smoothed my hair
and cooled at the brookside my brow and throat
to love a year
down through the beeches i looked at last
on the little red gate and the well-sweep near
of light through the leaves
the sundown's blaze on her window-pane
the bloom of her roses under the eaves
the house and the trees
the barn's brown gable the vine by the door --
nothing changed but the hives of bees
forward and back
went drearily singing the chore-girl small
draping each hive with a shred of black
had the chill of snow
for i knew she was telling the bees of one
gone on the journey we all must go
for the dead to-day
haply her blind old grandsire sleeps
the fret and the pain of his age away
with his cane to his chin
the old man sat and the chore-girl still
sung to the bees stealing out and in
in my ear sounds on
stay at home pretty bees fly not hence
mistress mary is dead and gone
and unfamiliar charm of face
it may be that across the foam
which bore her from her childhood's home
by some strange spell my katie brought
along with english creeds and thought--
entangled in her golden hair--
some english sunshine warmth and air
i cannot tell --but here to-day
a thousand billowy leagues away
from that green isle whose twilight skies
no darker are than katie's eyes
she seems to me go where she will
an english girl in england still
and daisies spring about her feet
or touched to life beneath her tread
an english cowslip lifts its head
and as to do her grace rise up
the primrose and the buttercup
i roam with her through fields of cane
and seem to stroll an english lane
which white with blossoms of the may
spreads its green carpet in her way
as fancy wills the path beneath
is golden gorse or purple heath
and now we hear in woodlands dim
their unarticulated hymn
now walk through rippling waves of wheat
now sink in mats of clover sweet
or see before us from the lawn
the lark go up to greet the dawn
all birds that love the english sky
throng round my path when she is by
the blackbird from a neighboring thorn
with music brims the cup of morn
and in a thick melodious rain
the mavis pours her mellow strain
but only when my katie's voice
makes all the listening woods rejoice
i hear--with cheeks that flush and pale--
the passion of the nightingale
is she that to my soul is dear
her glorious fancies come from far
beneath the silver evening-star
and yet her heart is ever near
which lesser souls may never know
god giveth them to her alone
and sweet they are as any tone
wherewith the wind may choose to blow
although no home were half so fair
no simplest duty is forgot
life hath no dim and lowly spot
that doth not in her sunshine share
which most leave undone or despise
for naught that sets one heart at ease
and giveth happiness or peace
is low-esteem d in her eyes
and though she seem of other birth
round us her heart intwines and clings
and patiently she folds her wings
to tread the humble paths of earth
and deeds of week-day holiness
fall from her noiseless as the snow
nor hath she ever chanced to know
that aught were easier than to bless
her life doth rightly harmonize
feeling or thought that was not true
ne'er made less beautiful the blue
unclouded heaven of her eyes
the spring-time of her childish years
hath never lost its fresh perfume
though knowing well that life hath room
for many blights and many tears
as a broad river's peaceful might
which by high tower and lowly mill
goes wandering at its own will
and yet doth ever flow aright
like quiet isles my duties lie
it flows around them and between
and makes them fresh and fair and green
sweet homes wherein to live and die
lights on to sing then leaves unbent
so is my memory thrilled and stirred --
i only know she came and went
the blue dome's measureless content
so my soul held that moment's heaven --
i only know she came and went
the orchards full of bloom and scent
so clove her may my wintry sleeps --
i only know she came and went
through the low doorway of my tent
the tent is struck the vision stays --
i only know she came and went
and life's last oil is nearly spent
one gush of light these eyes will brim
only to think she came and went
held while it breathed so beautiful a soul
that when she died all recognized her birth
and had their sorrow in serene control
the wintry wind seemed whispering round her bier
and when the tomb-door opened with a start
we heard it echoed from within -- not here
note in these flowers a delicater hue
should spring come earlier to this hallowed grass
or the bee later linger on the dew --
such sweetness grace as only goodness can
that even her dust and this her monument
have yet a spell to stay one lonely man
lonely through life but looking for the day
when what is mortal of himself shall sleep
when human passion shall have passed away
and love no longer be a thing to weep
on shore are dreaming shells
and the waiting heart and the loving lips
blossoms and bridal bells
on shore are longing eyes
and the far horizon's haunting dream
of ships that sail the skies
like spectres from the deep
on shore are the ghosts of drowning cries
that cross the waves of sleep
on shore are shells that moan
old anchors buried in barren sand
sea-mist and dreams alone
whose earthly summers are but three
and yet a voyager is he
greater than drake or frobisher
than all their peers together
he is a brave discoverer
and far beyond the tether
of them who seek the frozen pole
has sailed where the noiseless surges roll
ay he has travelled whither
a winged pilot steered his bark
through the portals of the dark
past hoary mimir's well and tree
across the unknown sea
came one who bore a flower
and laid it in his dimpled hand
with this command
henceforth thou art a rover
thou must make a voyage far
sail beneath the evening star
and a wondrous land discover
--with his sweet smile innocent
our little kinsman went
from the absent has been heard
who can tell
how he fares or answer well
what the little one has found
since he left us outward bound
would that he might return
then should we learn
from the pricking of his chart
how the skyey roadways part
hush does not the baby this way bring
to lay beside this severed curl
some starry offering
of chrysolite or pearl
we may follow on his track
but he comes not back
and yet i dare aver
he is a brave discoverer
of climes his elders do not know
he has more learning than appears
on the scroll of twice three thousand years
more than in the groves is taught
or from furthest indies brought
he knows perchance how spirits fare --
what shapes the angels wear
what is their guise and speech
in those lands beyond our reach --
and his eyes behold
things that shall never never be to mortal hearers told
they love their single selves the best
a sword is in the marriage bed
their separate slumbers are not rest
they quarrel and make up again
they give and suffer worlds of pain
both right and wrong
they struggle long
till some good day when they are old
some dark day when the bells are tolled
death having taken their best of life
they lose themselves and find each other
they know that they are husband wife
for weeping they are father mother
scribner's sons
behind the toil the camp the march the strife
the wandering and the desert vast afar
beyond this weary way behold the sea
the sea o'erswept by clouds and winds and wings
by thoughts and wishes manifold whose breath
is freshness and whose mighty pulse is peace
palter no question of the dim beyond
cut loose the bark such voyage itself is rest
majestic motion unimpeded scope
a widening heaven a current without care
eternity --deliverance promise course
time-tired souls salute thee from the shore
oh let me cling
to thy white garments floating past
even to shadows which they cast
i cling i cling
show me thy face
just once once more a single night
cannot have brought a loss a blight
upon its grace
robed for the grave
see what a smile their red lips wear
to lay them living wilt thou dare
into a grave
i know i know
i left thee first now i repent
i listen now i never meant
to have thee go
thou hadst for me
alas although my heart was stirred
i never fully knew or heard
it was for me
o yesterday
my yesterday thy sorest pain
were joy couldst thou but come again --
sweet yesterday
o little swallow
couldst thou tell me which road is best
cleaving high air with thy soft breast
for keel o swallow
thou must o'erlook
my seas and know if i mistake
i would not the same harbor make
which yesterday forsook
of unseen rowers
on unknown land the waters dash
who knows how it be wise or rash
to meet the rowers
prem prem
venetia's boatmen lean and cry
with voiceless lips i drift and lie
upon the twilight sea
had sound of warning
sweet little one whate'er befall
thou wilt not know that it was all
in vain thy warning
i may not borrow
a hope a help i close my eyes
cold wind blows from the bridge of sighs
kneeling i wait to-morrow
that from the master's bow
with pangs of joy or woe
feels music's soul through every fibre sent
whispers the ravished strings
more than he knew or meant
old summers in its memory glow
the secrets of the wind it sings
it hears the april-loosened springs
and mixes with its mood
all it dreamed when it stood
in the murmurous pine-wood
long ago
steeped every bough and cone
the roar of the brook in the glen
came dim from the distance blown
the wind through its glooms sang low
and it swayed to and fro
with delight as it stood
in the wonderful wood
long ago
that only said live and rejoice
that asked not for causes and reasons
but made us all feeling and voice
when we went with the winds in their blowing
when nature and we were peers
and we seemed to share in the flowing
of the inexhaustible years
have we not from the earth drawn juices
too fine for earth's sordid uses
have i heard have i seen
all i feel and i know
doth my heart overween
or could it have been
long ago
an odor from dreamland sent
that makes the ghost seem nigh me
of a splendor that came and went
of a life lived somewhere i know not
in what diviner sphere
of memories that stay not and go not
like music heard once by an ear
that cannot forget or reclaim it
a something so shy it would shame it
to make it a show
a something too vague could i name it
for others to know
as if i had lived it or dreamed it
as if i had acted or schemed it
long ago
this life that stirs in my brain
could i be both maiden and lover
moon and tide bee and clover
as i seem to have been once again
could i but speak and show it
this pleasure more sharp than pain
that baffles and lures me so
the world should not lack a poet
such as it had
in the ages glad
long ago
the twilight darkens the curlew calls
along the sea-sands damp and brown
the traveller hastens toward the town
and the tide rises the tide falls
but the sea in the darkness calls and calls
the little waves with their soft white hands
efface the footprints in the sands
and the tide rises the tide falls
stamp and neigh as the hostler calls
the day returns but nevermore
returns the traveller to the shore
and the tide rises the tide falls
the fields a later aspect wear
since summer's garishness is gone
some grains of night tincture the noontide air
now circle wider 'bout their stem
like sentries that by slow degrees
perform their rounds gently protecting them
the sun allows a scantier light
behind each needle of the pine
there lurks a small auxiliar to the night
around beneath me and on high
it rocks the night it soothes the day
and everywhere is nature's lullaby
when he has made his winter bed
his creak grown fainter but more broad
a film of autumn o'er the summer spread
now beat across some meadow's bay
and as they tack and veer on high
with faint and hurried click beguile the way
some leaf obeys its maker's call
and through their hollow aisles it plays
with delicate touch the prelude of the fall
it lightly lays itself along
where the same hand hath pillowed them
resigned to sleep upon the old year's throng
the furthest pool is strewn with leaves
which float upon their watery bier
where is no eye that sees no heart that grieves
the crisped and yellow leaves around
are hue and texture of my mood --
and these rough burrs my heirlooms on the ground
they are no wealthier than i
but with as brave a core within
they rear their boughs to the october sky
the charge of winter's cavalry
keeping a simple roman state
discumbered of their persian luxury
i found the fresh rhodora in the woods
spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook
to please the desert and the sluggish brook
the purple petals fallen in the pool
made the black water with their beauty gay
here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool
and court the flower that cheapens his array
rhodora if the sages ask thee why
this charm is wasted on the earth and sky
tell them dear that if eyes were made for seeing
then beauty is its own excuse for being
why thou wert there o rival of the rose
i never thought to ask i never knew
but in my simple ignorance suppose
the self-same power that brought me there brought you
to be the highest in thy quire --
to be a meteor in the sky
or comet that may range on high
only a zephyr that may blow
among the reeds by the river low
give me thy most privy place
where to run my airy race
let me sigh upon a reed
or in the woods with leafy din
whisper the still evening in
some still work give me to do --
only--be it near to you
for i'd rather be thy child
and pupil in the forest wild
than be the king of men elsewhere
and most sovereign slave of care
to reckon thee i ask what cause
set free so much of red from heats
at core of earth and mixed such sweets
with sour and spice what was that strength
which out of darkness length by length
spun all thy shining thread of vine
netting the fields in bond as thine
i see thy tendrils drink by sips
from grass and clover's smiling lips
i hear thy roots dig down for wells
tapping the meadow's hidden cells
whole generations of green things
descended from long lines of springs
i see make room for thee to bide
a quiet comrade by their side
i see the creeping peoples go
mysterious journeys to and fro
treading to right and left of thee
doing thee homage wonderingly
i see the wild bees as they fare
thy cups of honey drink but spare
i mark thee bathe and bathe again
in sweet uncalendared spring rain
i watch how all may has of sun
makes haste to have thy ripeness done
while all her nights let dews escape
to set and cool thy perfect shape
ah fruit of fruits no more i pause
to dream and seek thy hidden laws
i stretch my hand and dare to taste
in instant of delicious waste
on single feast all things that went
to make the empire thou hast spent
where thou art is clime for me
let them sail for porto rique
far-off heats through seas to seek
i will follow thee alone
thou animated torrid-zone
zigzag steerer desert cheerer
let me chase thy waving lines
keep me nearer me thy hearer
singing over shrubs and vines
joy of thy dominion
sailor of the atmosphere
swimmer through the waves of air
voyager of light and noon
epicurean of june
wait i prithee till i come
within earshot of thy hum --
all without is martyrdom
with a net of shining haze
silvers the horizon wall
and with softness touching all
tints the human countenance
with a color of romance
and infusing subtle heats
turns the sod to violets
thou in sunny solitudes
rover of the underwoods
the green silence dost displace
with thy mellow breezy bass
sweet to me thy drowsy tone
tells of countless sunny hours
long days and solid banks of flowers
of gulfs of sweetness without bound
in indian wildernesses found
of syrian peace immortal leisure
firmest cheer and bird-like pleasure
hath my insect never seen
but violets and bilberry bells
maple-sap and daffodels
grass with green flag half-mast high
succory to match the sky
columbine with horn of honey
scented fern and agrimony
clover catchfly adder's-tongue
and brier-roses dwelt among
all beside was unknown waste
all was picture as he passed
yellow-breeched philosopher
seeing only what is fair
sipping only what is sweet
thou dost mock at fate and care
leave the chaff and take the wheat
when the fierce northwestern blast
cools sea and land so far and fast
thou already slumberest deep
woe and want thou canst outsleep
want and woe which torture us
thy sleep makes ridiculous
'twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large
down in the meadow where is richer feed
and will not mind to hit their proper targe
our shakespeare's life were rich to live again
what plutarch read that was not good nor true
nor shakespeare's books unless his books were men
what care i for the greeks or for troy town
if juster battles are enacted now
between the ants upon this hummock's crown
if red or black the gods will favor most
or yonder ajax will the phalanx turn
struggling to heave some rock against the host
for now i've business with this drop of dew
and see you not the clouds prepare a shower --
i'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue
last year with nicer skill than monarchs use
a clover tuft is pillow for my head
and violets quite overtop my shoes
and gently swells the wind to say all's well
the scattered drops are falling fast and thin
some in the pool some in the flower-bell
but see that globe come rolling down its stem
now like a lonely planet there it floats
and now it sinks into my garment's hem
and richness rare distills from every bough
the wind alone it is makes every sound
shaking down crystals on the leaves below
who could not with his beams e'er melt me so
my dripping locks --they would become an elf
who in a beaded coat does gayly go
fringing the dusty road with harmless gold
first pledge of blithesome may
which children pluck and full of pride uphold
high-hearted buccaneers o'erjoyed that they
an eldorado in the grass have found
which not the rich earth's ample round
may match in wealth thou art more dear to me
than all the prouder summer-blooms may be
through the primeval hush of indian seas
nor wrinkled the lean brow
of age to rob the lover's heart of ease
'tis the spring's largess which she scatters now
to rich and poor alike with lavish hand
though most hearts never understand
to take it at god's value but pass by
the offered wealth with unrewarded eye
to look at thee unlocks a warmer clime
the eyes thou givest me
are in the heart and heed not space or time
not in mid june the golden-cuirassed bee
feels a more summer-like warm ravishment
in the white lily's breezy tent
his fragrant sybaris than i when first
from the dark green thy yellow circles burst
of meadows where in sun the cattle graze
where as the breezes pass
the gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways
of leaves that slumber in a cloudy mass
or whiten in the wind of waters blue
that from the distance sparkle through
some woodland gap and of a sky above
where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move
the sight of thee calls back the robin's song
who from the dark old tree
beside the door sang clearly all day long
and i secure in childish piety
listened as if i heard an angel sing
with news from heaven which he could bring
fresh every day to my untainted ears
when birds and flowers and i were happy peers
when thou for all thy gold so common art
thou teachest me to deem
more sacredly of every human heart
since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam
of heaven and could some wondrous secret show
did we but pay the love we owe
and with a child's undoubting wisdom look
on all these living pages of god's book
sails the unshadowed main --
the venturous bark that flings
on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
in gulfs enchanted where the siren sings
and coral reefs lie bare
where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair
wrecked is the ship of pearl
and every chambered cell
where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell
as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell
before thee lies revealed --
its irised ceiling rent its sunless crypt unsealed
that spread his lustrous coil
still as the spiral grew
he left the past year's dwelling for the new
stole with soft step its shining archway through
built up its idle door
stretched in his last-found home and knew the old no more
child of the wandering sea
cast from her lap forlorn
from thy dead lips a clearer note is born
than ever triton blew from wreath d horn
while on mine ear it rings
through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings
as the swift seasons roll
leave thy low-vaulted past
let each new temple nobler than the last
shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast
till thou at length art free
leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea
thou dalliest outside the palace gate
till on thine idle armor lie the late
and heavy dews the morn's bright scornful eye
reminds thee then in subtle mockery
thou smilest at the window where i wait
who bade thee ride for life in empty state
my days go on while false hours prophesy
thy quick return at last in sad despair
i cease to bid thee leave thee free as air
when lo thou stand'st before me glad and fleet
and lay'st undreamed-of treasures at my feet
ah messenger thy royal blood to buy
i am too poor thou art the king not i
feeling deeper than all thought
souls to souls can never teach
what unto themselves was taught
man by man was never seen
all our deep communing fails
to remove the shadowy screen
mind with mind did never meet
we are columns left alone
of a temple once complete
far apart though seeming near
in our light we scattered lie
all is thus but starlight here
but a babbling summer stream
what our wise philosophy
but the glancing of a dream
melts the scattered stars of thought
only when we live above
what the dim-eyed world hath taught
by the fount which gave them birth
and by inspiration led
which they never drew from earth
swelling till they meet and run
shall be all absorbed again
melting flowing into one
wove filmy yellow nets of sun
into the drowsy snare too soon
the guards fell one by one
a beggar went and laughed this brings
me chance at last to see if men
fare better being kings
propping his face with listless hand
watching the hour-glass sifting down
too slow its shining sand
the beggar turned and pitying
replied like one in dream of thee
nothing i want the king
shook off the crown and threw it by
o man thou must have known he said
a greater king than i
went king and beggar hand in hand
whispered the king shall i know when
before his throne i stand
were wiping from the king's hot brow
the crimson lines the crown had traced
this is his presence now
unwove its yellow nets of sun
out of their sleep in terror soon
the guards waked one by one
the king the cry ran to and fro
beggar and king they laughed i ween
the laugh that free men know
the king came not they called him dead
and made his eldest son one day
slave in his father's stead
whom arno shall remember long
how stern of lineament how grim
the father was of tuscan song
there but the burning sense of wrong
perpetual care and scorn abide
small friendship for the lordly throng
distrust of all the world beside
no dream his life was --but a fight
could any beatrice see
a lover in that anchorite
to that cold ghibelline's gloomy sight
who could have guessed the visions came
of beauty veiled with heavenly light
in circles of eternal flame
the cheeks with fast and sorrow thin
the rigid front almost morose
but for the patient hope within
declare a life whose course hath been
unsullied still though still severe
which through the wavering days of sin
kept itself icy-chaste and clear
when wandering once forlorn he strayed
with no companion save his book
to corvo's hushed monastic shade
where as the benedictine laid
his palm upon the convent's guest
the single boon for which he prayed
was peace that pilgrim's one request
betrays no spirit of repose
the sullen warrior sole we trace
the marble man of many woes
such was his mien when first arose
the thought of that strange tale divine
when hell he peopled with his foes
the scourge of many a guilty line
the tyrant canker-worms of earth
baron and duke in hold and hall
cursed the dark hour that gave him birth
he used rome's harlot for his mirth
plucked bare hypocrisy and crime
but valiant souls of knightly worth
transmitted to the rolls of time
the only righteous judge art thou
that poor old exile sad and lone
is latium's other virgil now
before his name the nations bow
his words are parcel of mankind
deep in whose hearts as on his brow
the marks have sunk of dante's mind
looks over wall street's mingled nations
where jews and gentiles most are wont
to throng for trade and last quotations
where hour by hour the rates of gold
outrival in the ears of people
the quarter-chimes serenely tolled
from trinity's undaunted steeple --
sound high above the modern clamor
above the cries of greed and gain
the curbstone war the auction's hammer
and swift on music's misty ways
it led from all this strife for millions
to ancient sweet-do-nothing days
among the kirtle-robed sicilians
and yet more joyous rose and shriller
i saw the minstrel where he stood
at ease against a doric pillar
one hand a droning organ played
the other held a pan's-pipe fashioned
like those of old to lips that made
the reeds give out that strain impassioned
a-strolling through this sordid city
and piping to the civic ear
the prelude of some pastoral ditty
the demigod had crossed the seas --
from haunts of shepherd nymph and satyr
and syracusan times --to these
far shores and twenty centuries later
but--hidden thus--there was no doubting
that all with crispy locks o'erspread
his gnarl d horns were somewhere sprouting
his club-feet cased in rusty shoes
were crossed as on some frieze you see them
and trousers patched of divers hues
concealed his crooked shanks beneath them
and o'er his mouth their changes shifted
and with his goat's-eyes looked around
where'er the passing current drifted
and soon as on trinacrian hills
the nymphs and herdsmen ran to hear him
even now the tradesmen from their tills
with clerks and porters crowded near him
from jauncey court and new street alley
as erst if pastorals be true
came beasts from every wooded valley
the random passers stayed to list --
a boxer gon rough and merry
a broadway daphnis on his tryst
with nais at the brooklyn ferry
in tattered cloak of army pattern
and galatea joined the throng --
a blowsy apple-vending slattern
while old silenus staggered out
from some new-fangled lunch-house handy
and bade the piper with a shout
to strike up yankee doodle dandy
like little fauns began to caper
his hair was all in tangled curl
her tawny legs were bare and taper
and still the gathering larger grew
and gave its pence and crowded nigher
while aye the shepherd-minstrel blew
his pipe and struck the gamut higher
with throbs her vernal passion taught her --
even here as on the vine-clad hill
or by the arethusan water
new forms may fold the speech new lands
arise within these ocean-portals
but music waves eternal wands --
enchantress of the souls of mortals
a man in blue with legal baton
and scoffed the vagrant demigod
and pushed him from the step i sat on
doubting i mused upon the cry
great pan is dead --and all the people
went on their ways --and clear and high
the quarter sounded from the steeple
nest that had song-birds in it
and when the last shall go
the dreary days to fill it
instead of lark or linnet
shall whirl dead leaves and snow
without the passion stronger
that skyward longs and sings --
woe's me i shall be lonely
when i can feel no longer
the impatience of their wings
like birds the brown leaves hover
but it will not be long
before their wild confusion
fall wavering down to cover
the poet and his song
tunes the sweetest ever heard
and i hang my cage there daily
but i never catch a bird
and they sing there all day long
but they will not fold their pinions
in the little cage of song
scribner's sons
at what age does love begin
your blue eyes have scarcely seen
summers three my fairy queen
but a miracle of sweets
soft approaches sly retreats
show the little archer there
hidden in your pretty hair
when didst learn a heart to win
prithee tell me dimple-chin
i can't tell you if i try
'tis so long i can't remember
ask some younger lass than i
do your heart and head keep pace
when does hoary love expire
when do frosts put out the fire
can its embers burn below
all that chill december snow
care you still soft hands to press
bonny heads to smooth and bless
when does love give up the chase
tell oh tell me grizzled-face
youth may pass and strength may die
but of love i can't foretoken
ask some older sage than i
nothing but a rose
any wind might rob of half its savor
any wind that blows
with a hand as chill --
ah the flying touch upon them lingers
stays and thrills them still
crumpled fold on fold --
once it lay upon her breast and ages
cannot make it old
the burden that it always bore
we live to love we meet to part
and part to meet on earth no more
we clasp each other to the heart
and part to meet on earth no more
for dews to fall and larks to soar
the time for tears is when we part
to meet upon the earth no more
the time for tears is when we part
to meet on this wide earth--no more
i bring palm branches found upon my way
but these will wither thine shall never die --
the sacred palms thou bearest to the sky
dear little saint though but a child in years
older in wisdom than my gray compeers
we doubt and tremble -- we with bated breath
talk of this mystery of life and death
thou strong in faith art gifted to conceive
beyond thy years and teach us to believe
gentle white palmer never more to roam
only sweet sister give me ere thou go'st
thy benediction --for my love thou know'st
we too are pilgrims travelling towards the shrine
pray that our pilgrimage may end like thine
behind the gates of hercules
before him not the ghost of shores
before him only shoreless seas
the good mate said now must we pray
for lo the very stars are gone
brave adm'ral speak --what shall i say
why say 'sail on sail on and on '
my men grow ghastly wan and weak
the stout mate thought of home a spray
of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek
what shall i say brave adm'ral say
if we sight naught but seas at dawn
why you shall say at break of day
'sail on sail on sail on and on '
until at last the blanched mate said
why now not even god would know
should i and all my men fall dead
these very winds forget their way
for god from these dread seas is gone
now speak brave adm'ral speak and say--
he said sail on sail on and on
this mad sea shows its teeth to-night
he curls his lip he lies in wait
with lifted teeth as if to bite
brave adm'ral say but one good word --
what shall we do when hope is gone
the words leaped as a leaping sword
sail on sail on sail on and on
and unapproachable by sea or shore
and unassailable by any band
of storming soldiery for evermore
by acts or pleasures --doing petty things
of work or warfare merchandise or rhyme
but we shall sit beside the silver springs
sages and martyrs and those blessed few
who loved us once and were beloved of old
to dwell with them and walk with them anew
musical motion the perpetual play
of every faculty that heaven bestows
through the bright busy and eternal day
while yet the dew was hoar
i went plucking purple pansies
till my love should come to shore
the fishing-lights their dances
were keeping out at sea
and come i sung my true love
come hasten home to me
and the white gulls rocked thereon
and the young moon dropped from heaven
and the lights hid one by one
all silently their glances
slipped down the cruel sea
and wait cried the night and wind and storm --
wait till i come to thee
sought some new sport to banish care
and to his jester cried sir fool
kneel now and make for us a prayer
and stood the mocking court before
they could not see the bitter smile
behind the painted grin he wore
upon the monarch's silken stool
his pleading voice arose o lord
be merciful to me a fool
from red with wrong to white as wool
the rod must heal the sin but lord
be merciful to me a fool
of truth and right o lord we stay
'tis by our follies that so long
we hold the earth from heaven away
go crushing blossoms without end
these hard well-meaning hands we thrust
among the heart-strings of a friend
who knows how sharp it pierced and stung
the word we had not sense to say--
who knows how grandly it had rung
the chastening stripes must cleanse them all
but for our blunders--oh in shame
before the eyes of heaven we fall
men crown the knave and scourge the tool
that did his will but thou o lord
be merciful to me a fool
the king and sought his gardens cool
and walked apart and murmured low
be merciful to me a fool
of our great martyr's face yes this is he
that brow all wisdom all benignity
that human humorous mouth those cheeks that hold
like some harsh landscape all the summer's gold
that spirit fit for sorrow as the sea
for storms to beat on the lone agony
those silent patient lips too well foretold
yes this is he who ruled a world of men
as might some prophet of the elder day --
brooding above the tempest and the fray
with deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken
a power was his beyond the touch of art
or arm d strength his pure and mighty heart
and i know thee as water is known of thirst
yet i knew thee of old at the first sweet sight
and thou art strange to me love to-night
i have set on the face of death in trust for thee
through long years keep it fresh on thy lips o friend
at the gate of silence give it back to me
charles scribner's sons
each with its loveliness as with a crown
drooped in a florist's window in a town
like flower on flower that night on beauty's breast
shrunk in the tangles of a harlot's hair
shut in the icy palm of her dead child
my spirits are fallen thro'
and i cannot carry this battle
o brother what shall i do
with spears that are deadly bright
against me so from the cradle
do fate and my fathers fight
thou wavering foolish soul
back to the ranks what matter
to win or to lose the whole
who hearken not well nor see
not thus by the outer issue
the wise shall interpret thee
the solemn event of things
the weakest of hearts defying
is stronger than all these kings
mind's doubt and bodily pain
and pallid thirst of the spirit
that is kin to the other twain
and ringletted vain desires
and vice with the spoils upon him
of thee and thy beaten sires
yet darken the hills about
thy part is with broken sabre
to rise on the last redoubt
nor covet the game at all
but fighting fighting fighting
die driven against the wall
and the winter's dawn is gray --
and said however you cheat your mind
the hours are flying away
has the sun a heart i said
to throw a morning flush on the cheek
whence a fairer flush has fled
was the cheek where i set my kiss
and on that side of the bed all night
death had watched and i on this
yet they made no answering sign
death's hand was on her failing heart
and his eyes said she is mine
half-veiled by her death-damp hair
and oh for the violet depths it hid
and the light i longed for there
and the night was overpast
and i said though never in life you spoke
oh speak with a look at last
as a bird's wing spread to flee
she turned her weary arms to death
and the light of her eyes to me
charles scribner's sons
and mark yon meeting of the sun and sea
how long they kiss in sight of all the lands
ah longer longer we
as egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine
and cleopatra night drinks all 'tis done
love lay thine hand in mine
glimmer ye waves round else unlighted sands
o night divorce our sun and sky apart
never our lips our hands

the homeward-wandering cows are lowing
dark grow the pine-woods dark and drear --
the woods that bring the sunset near
far off its fading glory shines
far off sublime and full of fear --
the pine-woods bring the sunset near
this dear one is our home our rest
yonder the stormy sea and here
the woods that bring the sunset near
save where the midnight city's pallid glow
lies like a lily white
on the black pool of night
across the swirling kills and gusty bay
to where the eddying tide
strikes hard the city's side
beneath that glow --the lily's heart to me --
a sleeping mother mild
and by her breast a child
supreme o'er death since deathless is thy essence
for putting off the dust
thou hast but blest me with a nearer presence
i breathe no selfish plaint no faithless chiding
on me the snowflakes fall
but thou hast gained a summer all-abiding
like some poor harper at a palace portal
i wait without and sing
while those i love glide in and dwell immortal
that marble door
admits no fruit of all our long endeavor
no fame-wreathed crown we wore
no garnered lore
no gold no gains
of all our toiling in the life immortal
no hoarded wealth remains
nor gilds nor stains
we entered here
no word came with our coming to remind us
what wondrous world was near
no hope no fear
naked we glide
no hand has mapped the constellations o'er us
no comrade at our side
no chart no guide
our footsteps fare
the beckoning of a father's hand we follow--
his love alone is there
no curse no care
the sun was low in the west
and my betrothed and i
in the churchyard paused to rest--
happy maiden and lover
dreaming the old dream over
the light winds wandered by
and robins chirped from the nest
was the grave of a little child
with a crumbling stone at the feet
and the ivy running wild--
tangled ivy and clover
folding it over and over
close to my sweetheart's feet
was the little mound up-piled
she shrank and clung to me
and her eyes were filled with tears
for a sorrow i did not see
lightly the winds were blowing
softly her tears were flowing--
tears for the unknown years
and a sorrow that was to be
the little drowsy stream
whispers a melancholy tune
as if it dreamed of june
and whispered in its dream
dust on their down and bloom
and out of many a weed-grown nook
the aster-flow rs look
with eyes of tender gloom
with smell of ripening fruit
through the sere grass in shy retreat
flutter at coming feet
the robins strange and mute
the harsh leaves overhead
only the querulous cricket grieves
and shrilling locust weaves
a song of summer dead
that day god sent you here
i knew the lavender was out
and it was mid of year
the ships sailed out to sea
yet ere that day was spent i knew
mine own had come to me
lurks still in grass or bough
so somewhat of the end o' june
lurks in each weather now
the old year strips the trees
but ever in my lavender
i hear the brawling bees

call to him cry to him
fly to him
bid him delay not
still as a stone--
all silent and cold
if my heart riot--
crush and defy it
should i grow bold--
say one dear thing to him
all my life fling to him
cling to him--
what to atone
is enough for my sinning
this were the cost to me
this were my winning--
that he were lost to me
not as a lover
at last if he part from me
tearing my heart from me--
hurt beyond cure --
calm and demure
then must i hold me--
in myself fold me--
lest he discover
showing no sign to him
by look of mine to him
what he has been to me--
how my heart turns to him
follows him yearns to him
prays him to love me
thou god above me
the angel raised his hand and looked and said
which world of all yon starry myriad
shall we make wing to the still solitude
became a harp whereon his voice and mood
made spheral music round his haloed head
i spake--for then i had not long been dead--
let me look round upon the vasts and brood
a moment on these orbs ere i decide
what is yon lower star that beauteous shines
and with soft splendor now incarnadines
our wings -- there would i go and there abide
he smiled as one who some child's thought divines
that is the world where yesternight you died
and joy perchance--but never never
happy childhood shall we twain
see each other's face forever
dear childhood lest the sight of me
thine old companion on the rack
of age should sadden even thee
but sturdy and stanch he stands
and the little toy soldier is red with rust
and his musket moulds in his hands
time was when the little toy dog was new
and the soldier was passing fair
and that was the time when our little boy blue
kissed them and put them there
and don't you make any noise
so toddling off to his trundle-bed
he dreampt of the pretty toys
and as he was dreaming an angel song
awakened our little boy blue --
oh the years are many the years are long
but the little toy friends are true
each in the same old place
awaiting the touch of a little hand
the smile of a little face
and they wonder as waiting these long years through
in the dust of that little chair
what has become of our little boy blue
since he kissed them and put them there
field published by charles scribner's sons
from out thy dark where she is now
come not with graveyard smell on thee
or withered roses on thy brow
and soundless step and clammy hand--
lo i am now no less alone
than in thy desolate doubtful land
that ever clung about her such
as with all things she brushed was blent
and with her quick and tender touch
crown thyself death let fall thy tread
so light that i may dream her there
and turn upon my dying bed
my love as though beneath her breath
and in her voice but call my name
and i will follow thee o death
charles scribner's sons
where the casement all the night
shone softened with a phosphor glow
of sympathetic light
and that her fledgling spirit pure
was pluming fast for flight
as i nightly climbed apace
and could scarce restrain the blossoms
when anear the destined place
her gentle whisper thrilled me
ere i gazed upon her face
should touch me into bloom
while all my being panted
to outpour its first perfume
when lo a paler flower than mine
had blossomed in the gloom
since she went out of the door--
no footstep shall cross the threshold
since she can come in no more
and mold and blight on the walls
and silence faints in the chambers
and darkness waits in the halls--
since she went that day of spring
borne in her pallid splendor
to dwell in the court of the king
with robes of silken sheen
and her wonderful frozen beauty
the lilies and silk between
but they died long long ago
'twas the odorous ghost of a blossom
that seemed through the dusk to glow
with hints of womanly grace
and her image swims in the mirror
that was so used to her face
where the sunshine riots outside
and the winds are merry and wanton
with the summer's pomp and pride
where love has closed the door
nor sunshine nor summer shall enter
since she can come in no more
higher than cloud can be
air with no breath of earth to stain it
pure on the perfect sea
jostling as they comb
delicate crash of tinkling water
broken in pearling foam
babble of brooks unseen
laughter of winds when they find the blossoms
brushing aside the green
foam-wreaths slipping by
soft as a snow of broken roses
afloat over mirrored sky
golden meshes fill
webs of fire that lace and tangle
never a moment still
fountains flower-like grow--
limpid bells on stems of silver--
out of a slope of snow
blue as a summer sky
when you blink at its arch sprung over
where in the grass you lie
burns where the low west clears
broken in air like a passionate promise
born of a moment's tears
clouds in the distance dwell
clouds that are cool for all their color
pure as a rose-lipped shell
gossamer wings unfurl
sailing so high they seem but sleeping
over yon bar of pearl
would it be missed or no--
if we stayed in the opal morning
floating forever so
only to dream all day--
blow salt wind from the north upstarting
scatter such dreams away
like dates of wars and deaths of kings
and yet recalls the very hour--
'twas noon by yonder village tower
and on the last blue noon in may--
the wind came briskly up this way
crisping the brook beside the road
then pausing here set down its load
of pine-scents and shook listlessly
two petals from that wild-rose tree
some vague remote ancestral touch of sorrow or of madness
a fear that is not fear a pain that has not pain's insistence
a tense of longing or of loss in some foregone existence
a subtle hurt that never pen has writ nor tongue has spoken--
such hurt perchance as nature feels when a blossomed bough is broken
to arcady to arcady
oh what's the way to arcady
where all the leaves are merry
the spring is rustling in the tree--
the tree the wind is blowing through--
it sets the blossoms flickering white
i knew not skies could burn so blue
nor any breezes blow so light
they blow an old-time way for me
across the world to arcady
sir poet with the rusty coat
quit mocking of the song-bird's note
how have you heart for any tune
you with the wayworn russet shoon
your scrip a-swinging by your side
gapes with a gaunt mouth hungry-wide
i'll brim it well with pieces red
if you will tell the way to tread
and if you but keep pace with me
you tread the way to arcady
and how long yet may the journey be
across the clover and the snow--
across the frost across the flowers--
through summer seconds and winter hours
i've trod the way my whole life long
and know not now where it may be
my guide is but the stir to song
that tells me i can not go wrong
or clear or dark the pathway be
upon the road to arcady
i was wont to sing once on a time--
there is never an echo now to ring
remembrance back to the trick of rhyme
the folk all sing in arcady
who hath not youth nor melody
your hair is white your face is wise--
that love must kiss that mortal's eyes
who hopes to see fair arcady
no gold can buy you entrance there
but beggared love may go all bare--
no wisdom won with weariness
but love goes in with folly's dress--
no fame that wit could ever win
but only love may lead love in
to arcady to arcady
wisdom and wealth i both have got
and fame and name and great men's praise
but love ah love i have it not
but far away and half forgot--
i only know her eyes were blue
but love--i fear i knew it not
we did not wed for lack of gold
and she is dead and i am old
all things have come since then to me
save love ah love and arcady
my way's for love and arcady
the gray is likewise in your hair
what love have you to lead you there
to arcady to arcady
my true companion's memory
with love he fills the spring-time air
with love he clothes the winter tree
oh past this poor horizon's bound
my song goes straight to one who stands--
her face all gladdening at the sound--
to lead me to the spring-green lands
to wander with enlacing hands
the songs within my breast that stir
are all of her are all of her
my maid is dead long years quoth he
she waits for me in arcady
to arcady to arcady
oh yon's the way to arcady
where all the leaves are merry
charles scribner's sons
the cool breeze waved the window-lace at play
the white rose on the porch was all in bloom
and out upon the bay
i watched the wheeling sea-birds go and come
while she bound up her hair i turned and lo
dana in her shower and fit to slay
all a man's hoarded prudence at a blow
gold hair that streamed away
as round some nymph a sunlit fountain's flow
she would not make me wait --but well i know
she took a good half-hour to loose and lay
those locks in dazzling disarrangement so
the flowing tresses of the woman
minerva pallas what you will--
a winsome creature greek or roman
in cousin's helmet masquerading
if not--then wisdom was a dame
for sonnets and for serenading
not made for love's despairs and blisses
did pallas wear her hair like that
was wisdom's mouth so shaped for kisses
and not the owl big-eyed and solemn
how very fresh she looks and yet
she's older far than trajan's column
and set this vine-work round it running
perhaps ere mighty phidias wrought
had lost its subtle skill and cunning
who knew to carve in such a fashion
perchance he graved the dainty head
for some brown girl that scorned his passion
where neither fount nor tree to-day is
he flung the jewel at the feet
of phryne or perhaps 'twas la s
his happy or unhappy story
nameless and dead these centuries
his work outlives him--there's his glory
beneath a lava-buried city
the countless summers came and went
with neither haste nor hate nor pity
the jewel fresh as any blossom
till some visconti dug it up--
to rise and fall on mabel's bosom
your gracious handiwork has guarded
see how your loving patient art
has come at last to be rewarded
and pangs of hopeless passion also
to have his carven agate-stone
on such a bosom rise and fall so
when the horn is on the hill bugle tarantara
with the crisp air stinging and the huntsmen singing
and a ten-tined buck to kill
we shall slay the buck of ten bugle tarantara
and the priest shall say benison and we shall ha'e venison
when we come home again
keep close and house him fair bugle tarantara
he'll still be a stranger to the merry thrill of danger
and the joy of the open air
let him come out to-day bugle tarantara
for the horses are neighing and the hounds are baying
and the hunt's up and away
it yet remains to see
if immortality unveil
a third event to me
as these that twice befell
parting is all we know of heaven
and all we need of hell
goes to the city ispahan
even before he gets so far
as the place where the clustered palm-trees are
at the last of the thirty palace-gates
the flower of the harem rose-in-bloom
orders a feast in his favorite room--
glittering squares of colored ice
sweetened with syrop tinctured with spice
creams and cordials and sugared dates
syrian apples othmanee quinces
limes and citrons and apricots
and wines that are known to eastern princes
and nubian slaves with smoking pots
of spic d meats and costliest fish
and all that the curious palate could wish
pass in and out of the cedarn doors
scattered over mosaic floors
are anemones myrtles and violets
and a musical fountain throws its jets
of a hundred colors into the air
the dusk sultana loosens her hair
and stains with the henna-plant the tips
of her pointed nails and bites her lips
till they bloom again but alas that rose
not for the sultan buds and blows
not for the sultan shah-zaman
when he goes to the city ispahan
the dancing-girls of samarcand
glide in like shapes from fairy-land
making a sudden mist in air
of fleecy veils and floating hair
and white arms lifted orient blood
runs in their veins shines in their eyes
and there in this eastern paradise
filled with the breath of sandal-wood
and khoten musk and aloes and myrrh
sits rose-in-bloom on a silk divan
sipping the wines of astrakhan
and her arab lover sits with her
that's when the sultan shah-zaman
goes to the city ispahan
flaming flickering on the night
from my neighbor's casement opposite
i know as well as i know to pray
i know as well as a tongue can say
that the innocent sultan shah-zaman
has gone to the city isfahan
'twas his belov d child his own first-born
and he was ag d ere the thought of morn
shook the sheer steeps of black oblivion
then all the works of darkness being done
through countless ons hopelessly forlorn
out to the very utmost verge and bourn
god at the last reluctant made the sun
he loved his darkness still for it was old
he grieved to see his eldest child take flight
and when his fiat lux the death-knell tolled
as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled
he snatched a remnant flying into light
and strewed it with the stars and called it night
of suns their legions withering at his nod
died into day hearing the voice of god
and seas new made immense and furious each
plunged and rolled forward feeling for a beach
he walked the waters with effulgence shod
this being made he yearned for worlds to make
from other chaos out beyond our night--
for to create is still god's prime delight
the large moon all alone sailed her dark lake
and the first tides were moving to her might
then darkness trembled and began to quake
big with the birth of stars and when he spake
a million worlds leapt into radiant light
wind of the norland snows
wind of the winnowed skies and sharp clear stars--
blow cold and keen across the naked hills
and crisp the lowland pools with crystal films
and blur the casement-squares with glittering ice
but go not near my love
wind of the few far clouds
wind of the gold and crimson sunset lands--
blow fresh and pure across the peaks and plains
and broaden the blue spaces of the heavens
and sway the grasses and the mountain pines
but let my dear one rest
wind of the sunrise seas
wind of the clinging mists and gray harsh rains--
blow moist and chill across the wastes of brine
and shut the sun out and the moon and stars
and lash the boughs against the dripping eaves
yet keep thou from my love
wind of the fragrant south
wind from the bowers of jasmine and of rose--
over magnolia glooms and lilied lakes
and flowering forests come with dewy wings
and stir the petals at her feet and kiss
the low mound where she lies
wind abeam and flooding tide
and the offing white with foam
and an old friend by my side
glad the long green waves to ride
through the crowded towns for gain
you and i who loved the sting
of the salt spray and the rain
and the gale across the main
loss of this--the slanted mast
and the roaring round the rail
and the sheeted spray we cast
round us as we seaward passed
with it sinks each thought of care
think not now of aging face
question not the whitening hair
youth still beckons everywhere
from the sky-line glows there now
bends the same blue overhead
and the waves we used to plow
part in beryl at the bow
in the old days when we sailed
seaward ere the night had flown
or the morning star had paled
like the shy eyes love has veiled
as the swift tide outward streamed
through a hushed and ghostly world
where our harbor reaches seemed
like a river that we dreamed
in the waters' crinkled glass
and the village wan and gray
and the startled cattle pass
through the tangled meadow-grass
straight into the gates of day
seen the crimson-edg d sun
burn the sea's gray bound away--
leap to universal sway
so the wind was strong and keen
oh what sun-crowned waves we clove
what cool shadows lurked between
those long combers pale and green
sorrow shatters them at last
for this brief hour we are boys
trim the sheet and face the blast
sail into the happy past
let me who have not any child to die
weep with you for the little one whose love
i have known nothing of
their pressure round your neck the hands you used
to kiss --such arms--such hands i never knew
may i not weep with you
between the tears that would be comforting --
but ah so sadder than yourselves am i
who have no child to die
he kindly stopped for me
the carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality
and i had put away
my labor and my leisure too
for his civility
their lessons scarcely done
we passed the fields of gazing grain
we passed the setting sun
a swelling of the ground
the roof was scarcely visible
the cornice but a mound
feels shorter than the day
i first surmised the horses' heads
were toward eternity
a very few a bird or two
to take a backward look
the old old sophistries of june --
a blue and gold mistake
almost thy plausibility
induces my belief
and softly through the altered air
hurries a timid leaf
oh last communion in the haze
permit a child to join
thy consecrated bread to break
taste thine immortal wine
within this quiet fold
among thy father's sheep
i lay to sleep
a heart that never for a night did rest
beyond its mother's breast
lord keep it close to thee
lest waking it should bleat and pine for me
of what thou art belov d unto me
all other voices wanting thine are dumb
all vision in thine absence vacancy
down the valleys of hall
i hurry amain to reach the plain
run the rapids and leap the fall
split at the rock and together again
accept my bed or narrow or wide
and flee from folly on every side
with a lover's pain to attain the plain
far from the hills of habersham
far from the valleys of hall
all through the valleys of hall
the rushes cried abide abide
the wilful waterweeds held me thrall
the laving laurel turned my tide
the ferns and the fondling grass said stay
the dewberry dipped for to work delay
and the little reeds sighed abide abide
here in the hills of habersham
here in the valleys of hall
veiling the valleys of hall
the hickory told me manifold
fair tales of shade the poplar tall
wrought me her shadowy self to hold
the chestnut the oak the walnut the pine
overleaning with flickering meaning and sign
said pass not so cold these manifold
deep shades of the hills of habersham
these glades in the valleys of hall
and oft in the valleys of hall
the white quartz shone and the smooth brook-stone
did bar me of passage with friendly brawl
and many a luminous jewel lone
--crystals clear or acloud with mist
ruby garnet and amethyst--
made lures with the lights of streaming stone
in the clefts of the hills of habersham
in the beds of the valleys of hall
and oh not the valleys of hall
avail i am fain for to water the plain
downward the voices of duty call--
downward to toil and be mixed with the main
the dry fields burn and the mills are to turn
and a myriad flowers mortally yearn
and the lordly main from beyond the plain
calls o'er the hills of habersham
calls through the valleys of hall

the wakened ocean murmured with dull tongue
till all the coast's mysterious caverns rung
with the waves' voice barbaric hoarse and drear
within this distant valley with rapt ear
i listened thrilled as though a spirit sung
or some gray god as when the world was young
moaned to his fellow mad with rage or fear
thus in the dark ere the first dawn methought
the sea's deep roar and sullen surge and shock
broke the long silence of eternity
and echoed from the summits where god wrought
building the world and ploughing the steep rock
with ploughs of ice-hills harnessed to the sea
the nations hear it like the voice of fate
within vast shores its strife makes desolate
still murmuring mid storms that to its breast
return as eagles screaming to their nest
is it the voice of worlds and isles that wait
while old earth crumbles to eternal rest
or some hoar monster calling to his mate
o ye that hear it moan about the shore
be still and listen that loud voice hath sung
where mountains rise where desert sands are blown
and when man's voice is dumb forevermore
'twill murmur on its craggy shores among
singing of gods and nations overthrown
not all a stranger as thy bugles blow
i feel within my blood old battles flow --
the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found
still surging dark against the christian bound
wide islam presses well its peoples know
thy heights that watch them wandering below
i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound
i turn and meet the cruel turbaned face
england 'tis sweet to be so much thy son
i feel the conqueror in my blood and race
last night trafalgar awed me and to-day
gibraltar wakened hark thy evening gun
startles the desert over africa
between the east and west that god has built
advance thy roman borders where thou wilt
while run thy armies true with his decrees
law justice liberty --great gifts are these
watch that they spread where english blood is spilt
lest mixt and sullied with his country's guilt
the soldier's life-stream flow and heaven displease
two swords there are one naked apt to smite
thy blade of war and battled-storied one
rejoices in the sheath and hides from light
american i am would wars were done
now westward look my country bids good-night --
peace to the world from ports without a gun
nor when the winds may blow
my jerry there has left the sea
with all its luck an' woe
for who would try the sea at all
must try it luck or no
how words they speak may fall--
they told him blunt he was too old
too slow with oar an' trawl
an' this is how he left the sea
an' luck an' woe an' all
out of his beaten way
if he is young 'twill do but then
if he is old an' gray
a month will be a year to him
be all to him you may
the door-yard for a deck
an' scans the boat a-goin' out
till she becomes a speck
then turns away his face as wet
as if she were a wreck
the days when we were wed
but he shall never know--my man--
the lack o' love or bread
while i can cast a stitch or fill
a needleful o' thread
how many yet there be
whose goodmen full as old as mine
are somewhere on the sea
who hear the breakin' bar an' think
o' jerry home an'--me
and well his work is done
with an equal grave for lord and knave
he buries them every one
he makes for the nearest shore
and god who sent him a thousand ship
will send him a thousand more
but some he'll save for a bleaching grave
and shoulder them in to shore --
shoulder them in shoulder them in
shoulder them in to shore
went out and where are they
in the port they made they are delayed
with the ships of yesterday
as the ships of long ago
and the ships of france they led him a dance
but he laid them all arow
is the sexton of the town
for sure and swift with a guiding lift
he shovels the dead men down
his honest graves are wide
as well they know who sleep below
the dredge of the deepest tide
and loud is the chorus skirled
with the burly note of his rumbling throat
he batters it down the world
where the ballads of eld were sung
and merry enough is the burden rough
but no man knows the tongue
and wilful she must have been
that she could bide at his gruesome side
when the first red dawn came in
she greets to his border home
and softer than sleep her hand's first sweep
that beckons and they come
to handle the tallest mast
from the royal barque to the slaver dark
he buries them all at last
he makes for the nearest shore
and god who sent him a thousand ship
will send him a thousand more
but some he'll save for a bleaching grave
and shoulder them in to shore --
shoulder them in shoulder them in
shoulder them in to shore

unerring home
there spread a cloud of dust along a plain
and underneath the cloud or in it raged
a furious battle and men yelled and swords
shocked upon swords and shields a prince's banner
wavered then staggered backward hemmed by foes
a craven hung along the battle's edge
and thought had i a sword of keener steel--
that blue blade that the king's son bears --but this
blunt thing --he snapt and flung it from his hand
and lowering crept away and left the field
then came the king's son wounded sore bestead
and weaponless and saw the broken sword
hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand
and ran and snatched it and with battle-shout
lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down
and saved a great cause that heroic day
sailed off in a wooden shoe --
sailed on a river of misty light
into a sea of dew
where are you going and what do you wish
the old moon asked the three
we have come to fish for the herring-fish
that live in this beautiful sea
nets of silver and gold have we
said wynken
blynken
and nod
as they rocked in the wooden shoe
and the wind that sped them all night long
ruffled the waves of dew
the little stars were the herring-fish
that lived in the beautiful sea
now cast your nets wherever you wish
but never afeard are we
so cried the stars to the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod
for the fish in the twinkling foam
then down from the sky came the wooden shoe
bringing the fishermen home
'twas all so pretty a sail it seemed
as if it could not be
and some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
of sailing that beautiful sea
but i shall name you the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod
and nod is a little head
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
is a wee one's trundle-bed
so shut your eyes while mother sings
of wonderful sights that be
and you shall see the beautiful things
as you rock on the misty sea
where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three --

with tassels and embroideries
and many blue-eyed violets beam
along the edges of the stream
i hear a voice that seems to say
now near at hand now far away
witchery--witchery--witchery
so innocent befits the scene
there's magic in that small bird's note--
see there he flits--the yellow-throat
a living sunbeam tipped with wings
a spark of light that shines and sings
witchery--witchery--witchery
if out of mary-land you came
you know the way that thither goes
where mary's lovely garden grows
fly swiftly back to her i pray
and try to call her down this way
witchery--witchery--witchery

that blossom into melody
and all her maids less fair than she
she does not need these pretty things
for everywhere she comes she brings
witchery--witchery--witchery
and flowers adorn each mossy bed
the waters babble as they run--
one thing is lacking only one
if mary were but here to-day
i would believe your charming lay
witchery--witchery--witchery

a woodland maid all robed in white--
the leaves dance round her with delight
the stream laughs out beneath her feet--

love takes my voice away
i cannot tell thee when we meet
what most i long to say
to know what beats in mine
then shouldst thou walk where'er thou art
in melodies divine
than to our ears belong
the music fills their throbbing throats
but silence steals the song
all night under blossom and star
the wild swan is dying without it
and the eagle cryeth afar
the sun he doth mount but to find it
searching the green earth o'er
but more doth a man's heart mind it
oh more more more
the infinite yearneth alone
the forests with wandering emotion
the thing they know not intone
creation arose but to see it
a million lamps in the blue
but a lover he shall be it
if one sweet maid is true
it seems so long ago --
the day we fished together
along the pocono
at dusk i waited for you
beside the lumber-mill
and there i heard a hidden bird
that chanted whip-poor-will
whippoorwill whippoorwill
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill
the mill-wheel hung at rest
the lonely star of evening
was quivering in the west
the veil of night was falling
the winds were folded still
and everywhere the trembling air
re-echoed whip-poor-will
whippoorwill whippoorwill
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill
i felt so much alone
the wide dark world was round me
and life was all unknown
the hand of sorrow touched me
and made my senses thrill
with all the pain that haunts the strain
of mournful whip-poor-will
whippoorwill whippoorwill
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill
an idle little lad
i had not learned the lessons
that make men wise and sad
i dreamed of grief and parting
and something seemed to fill
my heart with tears while in my ears
resounded whip-poor-will
whippoorwill whippoorwill
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill
that lightly passed away
but i have known the substance
of sorrow since that day
for nevermore at twilight
beside the silent mill
i'll wait for you in the falling dew
and hear the whip-poor-will
whippoorwill whippoorwill
sad and shrill -- whippoorwill
in that fair land of light
the pains and fears that touch us
along this edge of night
i think all earthly grieving
and all our mortal ill
to you must seem like a boy's sad dream
who hears the whip-poor-will
whippoorwill whippoorwill
a passing thrill-- whippoorwill
scribner's sons
when lusty male birds fight and sing
inform my words and make my lines
as sweet as flowers as strong as vines
of rain on grass of dew on flower
the fertilizing song be mine
nut-flavored racy keen as wine
from me before my forces fail
or ere the ecstatic impulse go
let all my buds to blossoms blow
the virgin soil feels sun and air
and longs to fill a higher state
there let my meanings germinate
but in some fresher vessel caught
be blended into sweeter forms
and fraught with purer aims and charms
to quicken hearts that flower alone
around my knees let scions rise
with heavenward-pointed destinies
and subtile change makes mould of me
there let earth show a fertile line
whence perfect wild-flowers leap and shine
when first i heard the nightingale a long-lost love deploring
so passionate so full of pain it sounded strange and eerie
i longed to hear a simpler strain --the wood notes of the veery
it sprinkles down from far away like light and love together
he drops the golden notes to greet his brooding mate his dearie
i only know one song more sweet --the vespers of the veery
i heard the blackbird with delight repeat his merry measure
the ballad was a pleasant one the tune was loud and cheery
and yet with every setting sun i listened for the veery
new england woods at close of day with that clear chant are ringing
and when my light of life is low and heart and flesh are weary
i fain would hear before i go the wood notes of the veery
scribner's sons
my love and i lay side by side
and heard the roaming forest wind
stir in the paling autumn-tide
because the round day was so fair
while memories of reluctant night
lurked in the blue dusk of her hair
shifting upon the silvery blue
with small innumerable sound
rustled to let the sunlight through
danced with their shadows on the floor
and the lost children of the wind
went straying homeward by our door
we watched the great deliberate sun
walk through the crimsoned hazy world
counting his hilltops one by one
and touched the vines along our eaves
another shadow stood without
and gloomed the dancing of the leaves
her great brown eyes were veiled and sad
with pondering some maze of dream
though all the splendid year was glad
her heart had grown she knew not why
but hurrying to the open door
against the verge of western sky
looming and sinister and black
the stealthy figure swift and huge
of one who strode and looked not back
he sits within the desert carved in stone
inscrutable colossal and alone
and ancienter than memory of things
graved on his front the sacred beetle clings
disdain sits on his lips and in a frown
scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown
the affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings
anear this presence the long caravan's
dazed camels stop and mute the bedouins stare
this symbol of past power more than man's
presages doom kings look--and kings despair
their sceptres tremble in their jewelled hands
and dark thrones totter in the baleful air
exceptions it must be looked for by the curious student in the
graveyard of old anthologies who now reads the simple cobbler of
agawam in america the tenth muse lately sprung up in america the
day of doom m'fingal or the columbiad skipping a generation from
barlow's death who reads with much seriousness any one of the group of
poets of which bryant in his earliest period was the centre halleck
pierpont sprague drake dana percival allston brainard mrs
osgood and miss brooks a few of them to be sure are remembered by an
occasional lyric --halleck by marco bozzaris a spirited ode in the
manner of campbell pierpont by his ringing lines warren's address to
the american soldiers drake by the american flag conventional but
not commonplace and marked by one very imaginative line and allston by
two rather excellent lyrics rosalie and america to great britain
the first poet to accomplish work of high sustained excellence was
bryant his poetry though never impassioned is uniformly elegant it
is often as chaste as landor at his best but it never surprises it is
not emotional personal suggestively imaginative in fact bryant's
muse is not lyrical with the exception of pinkney and hoffman whose
sparkling and bright if technically defective is a true song we
must wait for our lyric poet till we reach edgar allan poe the
greatest--one inclines to say the only--master of musical quality in
verse whom america has produced
the american revolution though never rising quite into the highest
class of poets he is our first genuine singer the indian
burying-ground and to a honey-bee are only less successful than the
graceful lines quoted
it in his essay entitled the poetic principle full of brilliancy
and spirit and added it was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have
been born too far south had he been a new englander it is probable
that he would have been ranked as the first of american lyrists by that
magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of american
letters in conducting the thing called the north american review
this passage very characteristic of poe's criticisms illustrates both
his championship of favorites and unmerciful scourging of foes
poem removes it at once from the company of those gay society verses
sparkling with conceits which won for willis the satiric comment of
lowell in a fable for critics
who says his best things in so foppish a way
with conceits and pet phrases so thickly o'erlaying 'em
that one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying 'em
over-ornament ruins both poem and prose --
just conceive of a muse with a ring in her nose
hardly have proved so ephemeral poe considered this poem willis's best
and i see no ground for calling the critic's judgment in question
among the most exquisite from his pen but it furnishes one of the most
famous among current quotations
and the grandeur that was rome
another phrase to the world's memory hardly any quotation is more
hackneyed than the last two verses of the first stanza drake was a
young poet the intimate friend and literary co-laborer of halleck who
died september in his twenty-fifth year
has aptly termed bryant's doric simplicity nothing of wordsworth's is
freer from ornament or from the least trace of affectation
raven still maintains its position at the head of its class no more
astonishing tour de force can be found in english literature
not of american sonnets
is worthy a place by the side of browning's lost leader in later
years whittier wrote a poem on the theme which while not a retraction
of his former position is penned in a tenderer more tolerant mood
the lost occasion is its title and it is only just to the poet to
read this second lyric hardly less successful in connection with the
first
constitution dr holmes's poem appeared in the boston advertiser
at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for
service
american poems
that is quite inimitable one inclines to agree with mr stedman of
all our poets he whittier is the most natural balladist
village blacksmith have made it deservedly popular one questions
whether the last stanza might not have been omitted with advantage both
to the unity and force of the poem
favorite poem of abraham lincoln
song no less than its popular melody has made it for many years a
favorite even better known is foster's old folks at home which is
said to have had a larger sale than any other american song
vigor rare in american poetry four stanzas are omitted
philip kearney
howe was on a visit to washington soon after the writer's return to
boston the lines were accepted for publication in the atlantic monthly
by james t fields who suggested the title of the poem the song did
not at first receive much notice but before the civil war was over had
become very popular
merit it is unfortunately marred by a few rather intemperate
expressions the sincerity of feeling is everywhere so evident however
that these must be forgiven the lines were written by a native of
baltimore prof james randall and were first published in april
the author of the famous song was teaching in a louisiana college when
he read in a new orleans paper the news of the attack on the
massachusetts troops as they passed through baltimore this newspaper
account inspired the verses
immortality deserves to be more widely known its simplicity
directness and truth of feeling are quite beyond praise according to a
story which one dislikes to believe apocryphal these lines were found
under the pillow of a wounded soldier near port royal south carolina

nothing of emerson's is quite so flawless as days a poem which for
conciseness and polish is worthy to be called classic
classic thomas hood's song beginning we watched her breathing
through the night
formerly prevailed in the rural districts of new england on the death
of a member of the family the bees were at once informed of the event
and their hives dressed in mourning the ceremonial was supposed to be
necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
new home this poem of whittier's is almost his highest achievement
lowell said in writing of the quaker poet appleton's cyclopedia of
american biography vi many of his poems such for example as
'telling the bees' in which description and sentiment mutually inspire
each other are as fine as any in the language i often think however
that whittier will live longest by his hymns and poems of purely
religious devotion i know of nothing similar in english that surpasses
the eternal goodness and perhaps half a dozen other poems
title this is one of the few cases where i have ventured to make
omissions
the new world and the new book who knows but that when all else of
american literature has vanished in forgetfulness some single little
masterpiece like this may remain to show the high-water mark not merely
of a single poet but of a nation and a generation the author of
thalatta was a dartmouth graduate a teacher and a disciple of
emerson
has not won as yet the recognition it deserves it has little lyrical
quality but for unconventionality charming turns of phrase and the
intimate knowledge of nature it reveals it is almost alone in american
poetry
emerson's poetry which beautiful in details is strangely uneven we
sigh as we think what an unrivalled lyric poet emerson would have been
had he been sustained at the heights he was capable of reaching no one
surpasses emerson at his best he is almost a great poet
taken from the autocrat of the breakfast table
poets emily dickinson is more imaginative but her utter scorn of form
in composition makes her work unique as it is less satisfying mrs
jackson was a favorite with emerson and he is said to have liked best
among her poems this sonnet thought
one of the most neglected stedman is inclined to think on a bust of
dante the finest of american lyrics see the nature of poetry
london ath neum occurs this sentence in point of power workmanship
and feeling among all poems written by americans we are inclined to
give first place to the 'port of ships ' of joaquin miller
faults one regrets that so much of his work highly imaginative as it
is is marred by over-elaboration and artificiality
its immense emotional undercurrent and its abrupt almost gasping
metre admirably suited to the impassioned mood of the speaker --these
are a few of the qualities that combine to make a woman's thought one
of the most remarkable poems in the book
lyrics the verse of this poet is uneven in merit he is too prone to
merely fanciful conceits but at his best tabb is imaginative as for
example in the lines where he says of angelo that he--
raised children unto god
thoughtful than spontaneous his religious poetry presents in the main
a rather striking similarity to the work of george herbert
subtlety of william blake many verses of the shy recluse whom mr
higginson so happily has introduced to the world are not only daring
and unconventional but recklessly defiant of form but as her editor
has well said when a thought takes one's breath away a lesson on
grammar seems an impertinence emily dickinson had more than a message
more than the charm of unexpectedness more than the gift of
phrase --she had and of how many americans can this be said an
intense imagination
thompson houghton mifflin co under the title of a
prelude
imaginative quality it is unequalled in nineteenth century literature
unless by leigh hunt's sonnet on the nile the same critic does not
scruple to declare of mr mifflin that he has a glorious imagination
and to prophesy for him a distinguished future seldom indeed has a
first book of verse won such instant and universal appreciation as mr
mifflin's volume of sonnets just issued as the american treasury goes
to press
